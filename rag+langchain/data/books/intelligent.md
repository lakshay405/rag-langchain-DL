_Preface to the Fourth Edition,_

_by Warren E. Buffett_

_I_ read the first edition of this book early in 1950, when I was nine-

teen. I thought then that it was by far the best book about investing

ever written. I still think it is.

```
To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a strato-
```
spheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information.

What’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making deci-

sions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that frame-

work. This book precisely and clearly prescribes the proper

framework. You must supply the emotional discipline.

```
If you follow the behavioral and business principles that Gra-
```
ham advocates—and if you pay special attention to the invaluable

advice in Chapters 8 and 20—you will not get a poor result from

your investments. (That represents more of an accomplishment

than you might think.) Whether you achieve outstanding results

will depend on the effort and intellect you apply to your invest-

ments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that pre-

vail during your investing career. The sillier the market’s behavior,

the greater the opportunity for the business-like investor. Follow

Graham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it.

```
To me, Ben Graham was far more than an author or a teacher.
```
More than any other man except my father, he influenced my life.

Shortly after Ben’s death in 1976, I wrote the following short

remembrance about him in the _Financial Analysts Journal._ As you

read the book, I believe you’ll perceive some of the qualities I men-

tioned in this tribute.

BENJAMIN GRAHAM
1894–
Several years ago Ben Graham, then almost eighty, expressed to a friend
```
the thought that he hoped every day to do “something foolish, something

creative and something generous.”

```
The inclusion of that first whimsical goal reflected his knack for pack-
```
aging ideas in a form that avoided any overtones of sermonizing or

self-importance. Although his ideas were powerful, their delivery was

unfailingly gentle.

```
Readers of this magazine need no elaboration of his achievements as
```
measured by the standard of creativity. It is rare that the founder of a disci-

pline does not find his work eclipsed in rather short order by successors.

But over forty years after publication of the book that brought structure

and logic to a disorderly and confused activity, it is difficult to think of pos-

sible candidates for even the runner-up position in the field of security

analysis. In an area where much looks foolish within weeks or months

after publication, Ben’s principles have remained sound—their value often

enhanced and better understood in the wake of financial storms that

demolished flimsier intellectual structures. His counsel of soundness

brought unfailing rewards to his followers—even to those with natural

abilities inferior to more gifted practitioners who stumbled while follow-

ing counsels of brilliance or fashion.

```
A remarkable aspect of Ben’s dominance of his professional field was
```
that he achieved it without that narrowness of mental activity that concen-

trates all effort on a single end. It was, rather, the incidental by-product of

an intellect whose breadth almost exceeded definition. Certainly I have

never met anyone with a mind of similar scope. Virtually total recall,

unending fascination with new knowledge, and an ability to recast it in a

form applicable to seemingly unrelated problems made exposure to his

thinking in any field a delight.

```
But his third imperative—generosity—was where he succeeded beyond
```
all others. I knew Ben as my teacher, my employer, and my friend. In each

relationship—just as with all his students, employees, and friends—there

was an absolutely open-ended, no-scores-kept generosity of ideas, time,

and spirit. If clarity of thinking was required, there was no better place to

go. And if encouragement or counsel was needed, Ben was there.

```
Walter Lippmann spoke of men who plant trees that other men will sit
```
under. Ben Graham was such a man.

_A Note About Benjamin Graham_

_by Jason Zweig_

```
Who was Benjamin Graham, and why should you listen to him?
Graham was not only one of the best investors who ever lived; he was
also the greatest practical investment thinker of all time. Before Graham,
money managers behaved much like a medieval guild, guided largely by
superstition, guesswork, and arcane rituals. Graham’s Security Analysis
was the textbook that transformed this musty circle into a modern pro-
fession.^1
AndThe Intelligent Investoris the first book ever to describe, for
individual investors, the emotional framework and analytical tools that
are essential to financial success. It remains the single best book on
investing ever written for the general public. The Intelligent Investor
was the first book I read when I joined ForbesMagazine as a cub
reporter in 1987, and I was struck by Graham’s certainty that, sooner
or later, all bull markets must end badly. That October, U.S. stocks suf-
fered their worst one-day crash in history, and I was hooked. (Today,
after the wild bull market of the late 1990s and the brutal bear market
that began in early 2000, The Intelligent Investorreads more prophet-
ically than ever.)
Graham came by his insights the hard way: by feeling firsthand the
anguish of financial loss and by studying for decades the history and
psychology of the markets. He was born Benjamin Grossbaum on
May 9, 1894, in London; his father was a dealer in china dishes and
figurines.^2 The family moved to New York when Ben was a year old. At
first they lived the good life—with a maid, a cook, and a French gov-
```
(^1) Coauthored with David Dodd and first published in 1934.
(^2) The Grossbaums changed their name to Graham during World War I,
when German-sounding names were regarded with suspicion.

erness—on upper Fifth Avenue. But Ben’s father died in 1903, the

porcelain business faltered, and the family slid haltingly into poverty.

Ben’s mother turned their home into a boardinghouse; then, borrow-

ing money to trade stocks “on margin,” she was wiped out in the crash

of 1907. For the rest of his life, Ben would recall the humiliation of

cashing a check for his mother and hearing the bank teller ask, “Is

Dorothy Grossbaum good for five dollars?”

```
Fortunately, Graham won a scholarship at Columbia, where his
```
brilliance burst into full flower. He graduated in 1914, second in his

class. Before the end of Graham’s final semester, three departments—

English, philosophy, and mathematics—asked him to join the faculty.

He was all of 20 years old.

```
Instead of academia, Graham decided to give Wall Street a shot.
```
He started as a clerk at a bond-trading firm, soon became an analyst,

then a partner, and before long was running his own investment part-

nership.

```
The Internet boom and bust would not have surprised Graham. In
```
April 1919, he earned a 250% return on the first day of trading for

Savold Tire, a new offering in the booming automotive business; by

October, the company had been exposed as a fraud and the stock

was worthless.

```
Graham became a master at researching stocks in microscopic,
```
almost molecular, detail. In 1925, plowing through the obscure

reports filed by oil pipelines with the U.S. Interstate Commerce Com-

mission, he learned that Northern Pipe Line Co.—then trading at $

per share—held at least $80 per share in high-quality bonds. (He

bought the stock, pestered its managers into raising the dividend, and

came away with $110 per share three years later.)

```
Despite a harrowing loss of nearly 70% during the Great Crash of
```
1929–1932, Graham survived and thrived in its aftermath, harvesting

bargains from the wreckage of the bull market. There is no exact

record of Graham’s earliest returns, but from 1936 until he retired in

1956, his Graham-Newman Corp. gained at least 14.7% annually,

versus 12.2% for the stock market as a whole—one of the best long-

term track records on Wall Street history.^3

(^3) Graham-Newman Corp. was an open-end mutual fund (see Chapter 9)
that Graham ran in partnership with Jerome Newman, a skilled investor in his
own right. For much of its history, the fund was closed to new investors. I am

A Note About Benjamin Graham xii
```
```
How did Graham do it? Combining his extraordinary intellectual
```
powers with profound common sense and vast experience, Graham

developed his core principles, which are at least as valid today as they

were during his lifetime:

- A stock is not just a ticker symbol or an electronic blip; it is an

```
ownership interest in an actual business, with an underlying value
that does not depend on its share price.
```
- The market is a pendulum that forever swings between unsustain-

```
able optimism (which makes stocks too expensive) and unjustified
pessimism (which makes them too cheap). The intelligent investor
is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.
```
- The future value of every investment is a function of its present

```
price. The higher the price you pay, the lower your return will be.
```
- No matter how careful you are, the one risk no investor can ever

```
eliminate is the risk of being wrong. Only by insisting on what
Graham called the “margin of safety”—never overpaying, no mat-
ter how exciting an investment seems to be—can you minimize
your odds of error.
```
- The secret to your financial success is inside yourself. If you

```
become a critical thinker who takes no Wall Street “fact” on faith,
and you invest with patient confidence, you can take steady
advantage of even the worst bear markets. By developing your
discipline and courage, you can refuse to let other people’s mood
swings govern your financial destiny. In the end, how your invest-
ments behave is much less important than how you behave.
```
```
The goal of this revised edition of The Intelligent Investoris to apply
```
Graham’s ideas to today’s financial markets while leaving his text

entirely intact (with the exception of footnotes for clarification).^4 After

each of Graham’s chapters you’ll find a new commentary. In these

reader’s guides, I’ve added recent examples that should show you just

how relevant—and how liberating—Graham’s principles remain today.

grateful to Walter Schloss for providing data essential to estimating

Graham-Newman’s returns. The 20% annual average return that Graham

cites in his Postscript (p. 532) appears not to take management fees into

account.

xiii A Note About Benjamin Graham

```
I envy you the excitement and enlightenment of reading Graham’s
masterpiece for the first time—or even the third or fourth time. Like all
classics, it alters how we view the world and renews itself by educat-
ing us. And the more you read it, the better it gets. With Graham as
your guide, you are guaranteed to become a vastly more intelligent
investor.

INTRODUCTION:

_What This Book Expects to Accomplish_

_T_ he purpose of this book is to supply, in a form suitable for lay-

men, guidance in the adoption and execution of an investment pol-

icy. Comparatively little will be said here about the technique of

analyzing securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment

principles and investors’ attitudes. We shall, however, provide a

number of condensed comparisons of specific securities—chiefly in

pairs appearing side by side in the New York Stock Exchange list—

in order to bring home in concrete fashion the important elements

involved in specific choices of common stocks.

```
But much of our space will be devoted to the historical patterns
```
of financial markets, in some cases running back over many

decades. To invest intelligently in securities one should be fore-

armed with an adequate knowledge of how the various types of

bonds and stocks have actually behaved under varying condi-

tions—some of which, at least, one is likely to meet again in one’s

own experience. No statement is more true and better applicable to

Wall Street than the famous warning of Santayana: “Those who do

not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

```
Our text is directed to investors as distinguished from specula-
```
tors, and our first task will be to clarify and emphasize this now all

but forgotten distinction. We may say at the outset that this is not a

“how to make a million” book. There are no sure and easy paths to

riches on Wall Street or anywhere else. It may be well to point up

what we have just said by a bit of financial history—especially

since there is more than one moral to be drawn from it. In the cli-

mactic year 1929 John J. Raskob, a most important figure nationally

as well as on Wall Street, extolled the blessings of capitalism in an

article in the _Ladies’ Home Journal,_ entitled “Everybody Ought to Be

### 1


```
Rich.” * His thesis was that savings of only $15 per month invested
in good common stocks—with dividends reinvested—would pro-
duce an estate of $80,000 in twenty years against total contributions
of only $3,600. If the General Motors tycoon was right, this was
indeed a simple road to riches. How nearly right was he? Our
rough calculation—based on assumed investment in the 30 stocks
making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)—indicates
that if Raskob’s prescription had been followed during 1929–1948,
the investor’s holdings at the beginning of 1949 would have been
worth about $8,500. This is a far cry from the great man’s promise
of $80,000, and it shows how little reliance can be placed on such
optimistic forecasts and assurances. But, as an aside, we should
remark that the return actually realized by the 20-year operation
would have been better than 8% compounded annually—and this
despite the fact that the investor would have begun his purchases
with the DJIA at 300 and ended with a valuation based on the 1948
closing level of 177. This record may be regarded as a persuasive
argument for the principle of regular monthly purchases of strong
common stocks through thick and thin—a program known as
“dollar-cost averaging.”
Since our book is not addressed to speculators, it is not meant
for those who trade in the market. Most of these people are guided
by charts or other largely mechanical means of determining the
right moments to buy and sell. The one principle that applies to
nearly all these so-called “technical approaches” is that one should
buy because a stock or the market has gone up and one should sell
```
_because_ it has declined. This is the exact opposite of sound business

sense everywhere else, and it is most unlikely that it can lead to

```
2 Introduction
```
```
* Raskob (1879–1950) was a director of Du Pont, the giant chemical com-
pany, and chairman of the finance committee at General Motors. He also
served as national chairman of the Democratic Party and was the driving
force behind the construction of the Empire State Building. Calculations by
finance professor Jeremy Siegel confirm that Raskob’s plan would have
grown to just under $9,000 after 20 years, although inflation would have
eaten away much of that gain. For the best recent look at Raskob’s views on
long-term stock investing, see the essay by financial adviser William Bern-
stein at http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/197/raskob.htm.
```

lasting success on Wall Street. In our own stock-market experience

and observation, extending over 50 years, we have not known a

single person who has consistently or lastingly made money by

thus “following the market.” We do not hesitate to declare that this

approach is as fallacious as it is popular. We shall illustrate what

we have just said—though, of course this should not be taken as

proof—by a later brief discussion of the famous Dow theory for

trading in the stock market.*

```
Since its first publication in 1949, revisions of The Intelligent
```
_Investor_ have appeared at intervals of approximately five years. In

updating the current version we shall have to deal with quite a

number of new developments since the 1965 edition was written.

These include:

1. An unprecedented advance in the interest rate on high-grade

```
bonds.
```
2. A fall of about 35% in the price level of leading common

```
stocks, ending in May 1970. This was the highest percentage
decline in some 30 years. (Countless issues of lower quality
had a much larger shrinkage.)
```
3. A persistent inflation of wholesale and consumer’s prices,

```
which gained momentum even in the face of a decline of gen-
eral business in 1970.
```
4. The rapid development of “conglomerate” companies, fran-

```
chise operations, and other relative novelties in business and
finance. (These include a number of tricky devices such as “let-
ter stock,”^1 proliferation of stock-option warrants, misleading
names, use of foreign banks, and others.)†
```
```
What This Book Expects to Accomplish 3
```
* Graham’s “brief discussion” is in two parts, on p. 33 and pp. 191–192.

For more detail on the Dow Theory, see [http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/](http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/)

dow/dowpage.html.

† Mutual funds bought “letter stock” in private transactions, then immedi-

ately revalued these shares at a higher public price (see Graham’s definition

on p. 579). That enabled these “go-go” funds to report unsustainably high

returns in the mid-1960s. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

cracked down on this abuse in 1969, and it is no longer a concern for fund

investors. Stock-option warrants are explained in Chapter 16.


5. Bankruptcy of our largest railroad, excessive short- and long-

```
term debt of many formerly strongly entrenched companies,
and even a disturbing problem of solvency among Wall Street
houses.*
```
6. The advent of the “performance” vogue in the management of

```
investment funds, including some bank-operated trust funds,
with disquieting results.
```
```
These phenomena will have our careful consideration, and some
```
will require changes in conclusions and emphasis from our previ-

ous edition. The underlying principles of sound investment should

not alter from decade to decade, but the application of these princi-

ples must be adapted to significant changes in the financial mecha-

nisms and climate.

```
The last statement was put to the test during the writing of the
```
present edition, the first draft of which was finished in January

1971. At that time the DJIA was in a strong recovery from its 1970

low of 632 and was advancing toward a 1971 high of 951, with

attendant general optimism. As the last draft was finished, in

November 1971, the market was in the throes of a new decline, car-

rying it down to 797 with a renewed general uneasiness about its

future. We have not allowed these fluctuations to affect our general

attitude toward sound investment policy, which remains substan-

tially unchanged since the first edition of this book in 1949.

```
The extent of the market’s shrinkage in 1969–70 should have
```
served to dispel an illusion that had been gaining ground dur-

ing the past two decades. This was that leading common stocks

could be bought at any time and at any price, with the assurance not

only of ultimate profit but also that any intervening loss would soon

be recouped by a renewed advance of the market to new high lev-

_4 Introduction_

* The Penn Central Transportation Co., then the biggest railroad in the

United States, sought bankruptcy protection on June 21, 1970—shocking

investors, who had never expected such a giant company to go under (see

p. 423). Among the companies with “excessive” debt Graham had in mind

were Ling-Temco-Vought and National General Corp. (see pp. 425 and

463). The “problem of solvency” on Wall Street emerged between 1968

and 1971, when several prestigious brokerages suddenly went bust.


```
els. That was too good to be true. At long last the stock market has
“returned to normal,” in the sense that both speculators and stock
investors must again be prepared to experience significant and per-
haps protracted falls as well as rises in the value of their holdings.
In the area of many secondary and third-line common stocks,
especially recently floated enterprises, the havoc wrought by the
last market break was catastrophic. This was nothing new in
itself—it had happened to a similar degree in 1961–62—but there
was now a novel element in the fact that some of the investment
funds had large commitments in highly speculative and obviously
overvalued issues of this type. Evidently it is not only the tyro who
needs to be warned that while enthusiasm may be necessary for
great accomplishments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invari-
ably leads to disaster.
The major question we shall have to deal with grows out of the
huge rise in the rate of interest on first-quality bonds. Since late 1967
the investor has been able to obtain more than twice as much
income from such bonds as he could from dividends on representa-
tive common stocks. At the beginning of 1972 the return was 7.19%
on highest-grade bonds versus only 2.76% on industrial stocks.
(This compares with 4.40% and 2.92% respectively at the end of
1964.) It is hard to realize that when we first wrote this book in 1949
the figures were almost the exact opposite: the bonds returned only
2.66% and the stocks yielded 6.82%.^2 In previous editions we have
```
consistently urged that at least 25% of the conservative investor’s

portfolio be held in common stocks, and we have favored in general

a 50–50 division between the two media. We must now consider

whether the current great advantage of bond yields over stock

yields would justify an all-bond policy until a more sensible rela-

tionship returns, as we expect it will. Naturally the question of con-

tinued inflation will be of great importance in reaching our decision

here. A chapter will be devoted to this discussion.*

```
What This Book Expects to Accomplish 5
```
```
* See Chapter 2. As of the beginning of 2003, U.S. Treasury bonds matur-
ing in 10 years yielded 3.8%, while stocks (as measured by the Dow Jones
Industrial Average) yielded 1.9%. (Note that this relationship is not all that
different from the 1964 figures that Graham cites.) The income generated
by top-quality bonds has been falling steadily since 1981.
```

```
In the past we have made a basic distinction between two kinds
```
of investors to whom this book was addressed—the “defensive”

and the “enterprising.” The defensive (or passive) investor will

place his chief emphasis on the avoidance of serious mistakes or

losses. His second aim will be freedom from effort, annoyance, and

the need for making frequent decisions. The determining trait of

the enterprising (or active, or aggressive) investor is his willingness

to devote time and care to the selection of securities that are both

sound and more attractive than the average. Over many decades

an enterprising investor of this sort could expect a worthwhile

reward for his extra skill and effort, in the form of a better average

return than that realized by the passive investor. We have some

doubt whether a really substantial extra recompense is promised to

the active investor under today’s conditions. But next year or the

years after may well be different. We shall accordingly continue to

devote attention to the possibilities for enterprising investment, as

they existed in former periods and may return.

```
It has long been the prevalent view that the art of success-
```
ful investment lies first in the choice of those industries that

are most likely to grow in the future and then in identifying the

most promising companies in these industries. For example, smart

investors—or their smart advisers—would long ago have recog-

nized the great growth possibilities of the computer industry as a

whole and of International Business Machines in particular. And

similarly for a number of other growth industries and growth com-

panies. But this is not as easy as it always looks in retrospect. To

bring this point home at the outset let us add here a paragraph that

we included first in the 1949 edition of this book.

```
Such an investor may for example be a buyer of air-transport
stocks because he believes their future is even more brilliant than
the trend the market already reflects. For this class of investor the
value of our book will lie more in its warnings against the pitfalls
lurking in this favorite investment approach than in any positive
technique that will help him along his path.*
```
```
6 Introduction
```
```
* “Air-transport stocks,” of course, generated as much excitement in the late
1940s and early 1950s as Internet stocks did a half century later. Among
the hottest mutual funds of that era were Aeronautical Securities and the
```

```
The pitfalls have proved particularly dangerous in the industry
```
we mentioned. It was, of course, easy to forecast that the volume of

air traffic would grow spectacularly over the years. Because of this

factor their shares became a favorite choice of the investment

funds. But despite the expansion of revenues—at a pace even

greater than in the computer industry—a combination of techno-

logical problems and overexpansion of capacity made for fluctuat-

ing and even disastrous profit figures. In the year 1970, despite a

new high in traffic figures, the airlines sustained a loss of some

$200 million for their shareholders. (They had shown losses also in

1945 and 1961.) The stocks of these companies once again showed a

greater decline in 1969–70 than did the general market. The record

shows that even the highly paid full-time experts of the mutual

funds were completely wrong about the fairly short-term future of

a major and nonesoteric industry.

```
On the other hand, while the investment funds had substantial
```
investments and substantial gains in IBM, the combination of its

apparently high price and the impossibility of being _certain_ about

```
its rate of growth prevented them from having more than, say, 3%
of their funds in this wonderful performer. Hence the effect of
this excellent choice on their overall results was by no means
decisive. Furthermore, many—if not most—of their investments in
computer-industry companies other than IBM appear to have been
unprofitable. From these two broad examples we draw two morals
for our readers:
```
1. Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not
    translate into obvious profits for investors.
2. The experts do not have dependable ways of selecting and
    concentrating on the most promising companies in the most
    promising industries.

```
What This Book Expects to Accomplish 7
```
```
Missiles-Rockets-Jets & Automation Fund. They, like the stocks they owned,
turned out to be an investing disaster. It is commonly accepted today that
the cumulative earnings of the airline industry over its entire history have
been negative. The lesson Graham is driving at is not that you should avoid
buying airline stocks, but that you should never succumb to the “certainty”
that any industry will outperform all others in the future.
```

```
The author did not follow this approach in his financial career as
```
fund manager, and he cannot offer either specific counsel or much

encouragement to those who may wish to try it.

```
What then will we aim to accomplish in this book? Our main
```
objective will be to guide the reader against the areas of possible

substantial error and to develop policies with which he will be

comfortable. We shall say quite a bit about the psychology of

investors. For indeed, the investor’s chief problem—and even his

worst enemy—is likely to be himself. (“The fault, dear investor, is

not in our stars—and not in our stocks—but in ourselves... .”) This

has proved the more true over recent decades as it has become

more necessary for conservative investors to acquire common

stocks and thus to expose themselves, willy-nilly, to the excitement

and the temptations of the stock market. By arguments, examples,

and exhortation, we hope to aid our readers to establish the proper

mental and emotional attitudes toward their investment decisions.

We have seen much more money made and _kept_ by “ordinary peo-

ple” who were temperamentally well suited for the investment

process than by those who lacked this quality, even though they

had an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-

market lore.

```
Additionally, we hope to implant in the reader a tendency to
```
measure or quantify. For 99 issues out of 100 we could say that at

some price they are cheap enough to buy and at some other price

they would be so dear that they should be sold. The habit of relat-

ing what is paid to what is being offered is an invaluable trait in

investment. In an article in a women’s magazine many years ago

we advised the readers to buy their stocks as they bought their gro-

ceries, not as they bought their perfume. The really dreadful losses

of the past few years (and on many similar occasions before) were

realized in those common-stock issues where the buyer forgot to

ask “How much?”

```
In June 1970 the question “How much?” could be answered by
```
the magic figure 9.40%—the yield obtainable on new offerings of

high-grade public-utility bonds. This has now dropped to about

7.3%, but even that return tempts us to ask, “Why give any other

answer?” But there are other possible answers, and these must be

carefully considered. Besides which, we repeat that both we and

our readers must be prepared in advance for the possibly quite dif-

ferent conditions of, say, 1973–1977.

```
8 Introduction
```

```
We shall therefore present in some detail a positive program for
```
common-stock investment, part of which is within the purview of

both classes of investors and part is intended mainly for the enter-

prising group. Strangely enough, we shall suggest as one of our

chief requirements here that our readers limit themselves to issues

selling not far above their tangible-asset value.* The reason for

this seemingly outmoded counsel is both practical and psychologi-

cal. Experience has taught us that, while there are many good

growth companies worth several times net assets, the buyer of

such shares will be too dependent on the vagaries and fluctuations

of the stock market. By contrast, the investor in shares, say, of

public-utility companies at about their net-asset value can always

consider himself the owner of an interest in sound and expanding

businesses, acquired at a rational price—regardless of what the

stock market might say to the contrary. The ultimate result of such

a conservative policy is likely to work out better than exciting

adventures into the glamorous and dangerous fields of anticipated

growth.

```
The art of investment has one characteristic that is not generally
```
appreciated. A creditable, if unspectacular, result can be achieved

by the lay investor with a minimum of effort and capability; but to

improve this easily attainable standard requires much application

and more than a trace of wisdom. If you merely try to bring _just a_

_little_ extra knowledge and cleverness to bear upon your investment

program, instead of realizing a little better than normal results, you

may well find that you have done worse.

```
Since anyone—by just buying and holding a representative
```
list—can equal the performance of the market averages, it would

seem a comparatively simple matter to “beat the averages”; but as

a matter of fact the proportion of smart people who try this and fail

is surprisingly large. Even the majority of the investment funds,

with all their experienced personnel, have not performed so well

```
What This Book Expects to Accomplish 9
```
```
* Tangible assets include a company’s physical property (like real estate,
factories, equipment, and inventories) as well as its financial balances (such
as cash, short-term investments, and accounts receivable). Among the ele-
ments not included in tangible assets are brands, copyrights, patents, fran-
chises, goodwill, and trademarks. To see how to calculate tangible-asset
value, see footnote † on p. 198.
```

over the years as has the general market. Allied to the foregoing

is the record of the published stock-market predictions of the

brokerage houses, for there is strong evidence that their calculated

forecasts have been somewhat less reliable than the simple tossing

of a coin.

```
In writing this book we have tried to keep this basic pitfall of
```
investment in mind. The virtues of a simple portfolio policy have

been emphasized—the purchase of high-grade bonds plus a diver-

sified list of leading common stocks—which any investor can carry

out with a little expert assistance. The adventure beyond this safe

and sound territory has been presented as fraught with challeng-

ing difficulties, especially in the area of temperament. Before

attempting such a venture the investor should feel sure of himself

and of his advisers—particularly as to whether they have a clear

concept of the differences between investment and speculation and

between market price and underlying value.

```
A strong-minded approach to investment, firmly based on the
```
margin-of-safety principle, can yield handsome rewards. But a

decision to try for these emoluments rather than for the assured

fruits of defensive investment should not be made without much

self-examination.

```
A final retrospective thought. When the young author entered
```
Wall Street in June 1914 no one had any inkling of what the next

half-century had in store. (The stock market did not even suspect

that a World War was to break out in two months, and close down

the New York Stock Exchange.) Now, in 1972, we find ourselves the

richest and most powerful country on earth, but beset by all sorts

of major problems and more apprehensive than confident of the

future. Yet if we confine our attention to American investment

experience, there is some comfort to be gleaned from the last 57

years. Through all their vicissitudes and casualties, as earth-

shaking as they were unforeseen, it remained true that sound

investment principles produced generally sound results. We must

act on the assumption that they will continue to do so.

```
Note to the Reader: This book does not address itself to the overall
```
financial policy of savers and investors; it deals only with that

portion of their funds which they are prepared to place in mar-

ketable (or redeemable) securities, that is, in bonds and stocks.

_10 Introduction_


Consequently we do not discuss such important media as savings

and time desposits, savings-and-loan-association accounts, life

insurance, annuities, and real-estate mortgages or equity owner-

ship. The reader should bear in mind that when he finds the word

“now,” or the equivalent, in the text, it refers to late 1971 or

early 1972.

**COMMENTARY ON THE INTRODUCTION**

```
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost;
that is where they should be. Now put the foundations under
them.
—Henry David Thoreau,Walden
```
```
Notice that Graham announces from the start that this book will not
tell you how to beat the market. No truthful book can.
Instead, this book will teach you three powerful lessons:
```
- how you can minimize the odds of suffering irreversible losses;
- how you can maximize the chances of achieving sustainable gains;
- how you can control the self-defeating behavior that keeps most
    investors from reaching their full potential.

```
Back in the boom years of the late 1990s, when technology stocks
seemed to be doubling in value every day, the notion that you could
lose almost all your money seemed absurd. But, by the end of 2002,
many of the dot-com and telecom stocks had lost 95% of their value
or more. Once you lose 95% of your money, you have to gain 1,900%
just to get back to where you started.^1 Taking a foolish risk can put
you so deep in the hole that it’s virtually impossible to get out. That’s
why Graham constantly emphasizes the importance of avoiding
losses—not just in Chapters 6, 14, and 20, but in the threads of warn-
ing that he has woven throughout his entire text.
But no matter how careful you are, the price of your investments
willgo down from time to time. While no one can eliminate that risk,

Graham will show you how to manage it—and how to get your fears
under control.
```
```
ARE YOU AN INTELLIGENT INVESTOR?
```
```
Now let’s answer a vitally important question. What exactly does Gra-
ham mean by an “intelligent” investor? Back in the first edition of this
book, Graham defines the term—and he makes it clear that this kind of
intelligence has nothing to do with IQ or SAT scores. It simply means
being patient, disciplined, and eager to learn; you must also be able to
harness your emotions and think for yourself. This kind of intelligence,
explains Graham, “is a trait more of the character than of the brain.”^2
There’s proof that high IQ and higher education are not enough to
```
make an investor intelligent. In 1998, Long-Term Capital Management

L.P., a hedge fund run by a battalion of mathematicians, computer

scientists, and two Nobel Prize–winning economists, lost more than

$2 billion in a matter of weeks on a huge bet that the bond market

would return to “normal.” But the bond market kept right on becoming

more and more abnormal—and LTCM had borrowed so much money

that its collapse nearly capsized the global financial system.^3

```
And back in the spring of 1720, Sir Isaac Newton owned shares in
```
the South Sea Company, the hottest stock in England. Sensing that

the market was getting out of hand, the great physicist muttered that

he “could calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the

madness of the people.” Newton dumped his South Sea shares, pock-

eting a 100% profit totaling £7,000. But just months later, swept up in

the wild enthusiasm of the market, Newton jumped back in at a much

higher price—and lost £20,000 (or more than $3 million in today’s

money). For the rest of his life, he forbade anyone to speak the words

“South Sea” in his presence.^4

html.


```
Sir Isaac Newton was one of the most intelligent people who ever
```
lived, as most of us would define intelligence. But, in Graham’s terms,

Newton was far from an intelligent investor. By letting the roar of the

crowd override his own judgment, the world’s greatest scientist acted

like a fool.

```
In short, if you’ve failed at investing so far, it’s not because you’re
```
stupid. It’s because, like Sir Isaac Newton, you haven’t developed the

emotional discipline that successful investing requires. In Chapter 8,

Graham describes how to enhance your intelligence by harnessing

your emotions and refusing to stoop to the market’s level of irrational-

ity. There you can master his lesson that being an intelligent investor is

more a matter of “character” than “brain.”

**A CHRONICLE OF CALAMITY**

Now let’s take a moment to look at some of the major financial devel-

opments of the past few years:

1. The worst market crash since the Great Depression, with U.S.

```
stocks losing 50.2% of their value—or $7.4 trillion—between
March 2000 and October 2002.
```
2. Far deeper drops in the share prices of the hottest companies of

```
the 1990s, including AOL, Cisco, JDS Uniphase, Lucent, and
Qualcomm—plus the utter destruction of hundreds of Internet
stocks.
```
3. Accusations of massive financial fraud at some of the largest and

```
most respected corporations in America, including Enron, Tyco,
and Xerox.
```
4. The bankruptcies of such once-glistening companies as Con-

```
seco, Global Crossing, and WorldCom.
```
5. Allegations that accounting firms cooked the books, and even

```
destroyed records, to help their clients mislead the investing public.
```
6. Charges that top executives at leading companies siphoned off

```
hundreds of millions of dollars for their own personal gain.
```
7. Proof that security analysts on Wall Street praised stocks publicly

```
but admitted privately that they were garbage.
```
8. A stock market that, even after its bloodcurdling decline, seems

```
overvalued by historical measures, suggesting to many experts
that stocks have further yet to fall.
```
```
14 Commentary on the Introduction
```

9. A relentless decline in interest rates that has left investors with no
    attractive alternative to stocks.
10. An investing environment bristling with the unpredictable menace

```
of global terrorism and war in the Middle East.
```
```
Much of this damage could have been (and was!) avoided by
```
investors who learned and lived by Graham’s principles. As Graham

puts it, “while enthusiasm may be necessary for great accomplish-

ments elsewhere, on Wall Street it almost invariably leads to disaster.”

By letting themselves get carried away—on Internet stocks, on big

“growth” stocks, on stocks as a whole—many people made the same

stupid mistakes as Sir Isaac Newton. They let other investors’ judg-

ments determine their own. They ignored Graham’s warning that “the

really dreadful losses” always occur after “the buyer forgot to ask

‘How much?’ ” Most painfully of all, by losing their self-control just

when they needed it the most, these people proved Graham’s asser-

tion that “the investor’s chief problem—and even his worst enemy—is

likely to be himself.”

**THE SURE THING THAT WASN’T**

Many of those people got especially carried away on technology and

Internet stocks, believing the high-tech hype that this industry would

keep outgrowing every other for years to come, if not forever:

- In mid-1999, after earning a 117.3% return in just the first five

```
months of the year, Monument Internet Fund portfolio manager
Alexander Cheung predicted that his fund would gain 50% a year
over the next three to five years and an annual average of 35%
“over the next 20 years.”^5
```
```
Commentary on the Introduction 15
```
(^5) Constance Loizos, “Q&A: Alex Cheung,” InvestmentNews,May 17, 1999,
p. 38. The highest 20-year return in mutual fund history was 25.8% per year,
achieved by the legendary Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan over the two
decades ending December 31, 1994. Lynch’s performance turned $10,000
into more than $982,000 in 20 years. Cheung was predicting that his fund
would turn $10,000 into more than $4 million over the same length of time.
Instead of regarding Cheung as ridiculously overoptimistic, investors threw


- After his Amerindo Technology Fund rose an incredible 248.9%
    in 1999, portfolio manager Alberto Vilar ridiculed anyone who
    dared to doubt that the Internet was a perpetual moneymaking
    machine: “If you’re out of this sector, you’re going to underper-
    form. You’re in a horse and buggy, and I’m in a Porsche. You
    don’t like tenfold growth opportunities? Then go with someone
    else.”^6
- In February 2000, hedge-fund manager James J. Cramer pro-
    claimed that Internet-related companies “are the only ones worth
    owning right now.” These “winners of the new world,” as he called
    them, “are the only ones that are going higher consistently in
    good days and bad.” Cramer even took a potshot at Graham: “You
    have to throw out all of the matrices and formulas and texts that
    existed before the Web.... If we used any of what Graham and
    Dodd teach us, we wouldn’t have a dime under management.”^7

```
All these so-called experts ignored Graham’s sober words of warn-
```
ing: “Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not

translate into obvious profits for investors.” While it seems easy to

foresee which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no real

value if most other investors are already expecting the same thing. By

the time everyone decides that a given industry is “obviously” the best

money at him, flinging more than $100 million into his fund over the next
year. A $10,000 investment in the Monument Internet Fund in May 1999
would have shrunk to roughly $2,000 by year-end 2002. (The Monument
fund no longer exists in its original form and is now known as Orbitex
Emerging Technology Fund.)
```
(^6) Lisa Reilly Cullen, “The Triple Digit Club,” Money,December, 1999, p. 170.
If you had invested $10,000 in Vilar’s fund at the end of 1999, you would
have finished 2002 with just $1,195 left—one of the worst destructions of
wealth in the history of the mutual-fund industry.

stocks did not go “higher consistently in good days and bad.” By year-end
2002, one of the 10 had already gone bankrupt, and a $10,000 investment
spread equally across Cramer’s picks would have lost 94%, leaving you
with a grand total of $597.44. Perhaps Cramer meant that his stocks would
be “winners” not in “the new world,” but in the world to come.


```
one to invest in, the prices of its stocks have been bid up so high that
its future returns have nowhere to go but down.
For now at least, no one has the gall to try claiming that technology
will still be the world’s greatest growth industry. But make sure you
remember this: The people who now claim that the next “sure thing”
will be health care, or energy, or real estate, or gold, are no more likely
to be right in the end than the hypesters of high tech turned out to be.
```
```
THE SILVER LINING
```
```
If no price seemed too high for stocks in the 1990s, in 2003 we’ve
reached the point at which no price appears to be low enough. The
pendulum has swung, as Graham knew it always does, from irrational
exuberance to unjustifiable pessimism. In 2002, investors yanked $27
billion out of stock mutual funds, and a survey conducted by the Secu-
rities Industry Association found that one out of 10 investors had cut
back on stocks by at least 25%. The same people who were eager to
buy stocks in the late 1990s—when they were going up in price and,
therefore, becoming expensive—sold stocks as they went down in
price and, by definition, became cheaper.
As Graham shows so brilliantly in Chapter 8, this is exactly back-
wards. The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky,
not less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their prices
fall. The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks
more costly to buy. And conversely (so long as you keep enough cash
on hand to meet your spending needs), you should welcome a bear
market, since it puts stocks back on sale.^8
So take heart: The death of the bull market is not the bad news
```
everyone believes it to be. Thanks to the decline in stock prices, now

is a considerably safer—and saner—time to be building wealth. Read

on, and let Graham show you how.

```
Commentary on the Introduction 17
```
(^8) The only exception to this rule is an investor in the advanced stage of
retirement, who may not be able to outlast a long bear market. Yet even an
elderly investor should not sell her stocks merely because they have gone
down in price; that approach not only turns her paper losses into real ones
but deprives her heirs of the potential to inherit those stocks at lower costs
for tax purposes.


CHAPTER 1

_Investment versus Speculation: Results to_

_Be Expected by the Intelligent Investor_

```
T his chapter will outline the viewpoints that will be set forth in
the remainder of the book. In particular we wish to develop at the
outset our concept of appropriate portfolio policy for the individ-
ual, nonprofessional investor.
```
```
Investment versus Speculation
```
```
What do we mean by “investor”? Throughout this book the
```
term will be used in contradistinction to “speculator.” As far back

as 1934, in our textbook _Security Analysis,_^1 we attempted a precise

```
formulation of the difference between the two, as follows: “An
investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis prom-
ises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not
meeting these requirements are speculative.”
While we have clung tenaciously to this definition over the
ensuing 38 years, it is worthwhile noting the radical changes that
have occurred in the use of the term “investor” during this period.
After the great market decline of 1929–1932 all common stocks
were widely regarded as speculative by nature. (A leading author-
ity stated flatly that only bonds could be bought for investment.^2 )
```
Thus we had then to defend our definition against the charge that

it gave too wide scope to the concept of investment.

```
Now our concern is of the opposite sort. We must prevent our
```
readers from accepting the common jargon which applies the term

“investor” to anybody and everybody in the stock market. In our

last edition we cited the following headline of a front-page article

of our leading financial journal in June 1962:

### 18


```
SMALL INVESTORS BEARISH, THEY ARE SELLING ODD-LOTS SHORT
```
In October 1970 the same journal had an editorial critical of what it

called “reckless investors,” who this time were rushing in on the

buying side.

```
These quotations well illustrate the confusion that has been
```
dominant for many years in the use of the words investment and

speculation. Think of our suggested definition of investment given

above, and compare it with the sale of a few shares of stock by an

inexperienced member of the public, who does not even own what

he is selling, and has some largely emotional conviction that he

will be able to buy them back at a much lower price. (It is not irrel-

evant to point out that when the 1962 article appeared the market

had already experienced a decline of major size, and was now get-

ting ready for an even greater upswing. It was about as poor a time

as possible for selling short.) In a more general sense, the later-used

phrase “reckless investors” could be regarded as a laughable con-

tradiction in terms—something like “spendthrift misers”—were

this misuse of language not so mischievous.

The newspaper employed the word “investor” in these
```
instances because, in the easy language of Wall Street, everyone

who buys or sells a security has become an investor, regardless of

what he buys, or for what purpose, or at what price, or whether for

cash or on margin. Compare this with the attitude of the public

toward common stocks in 1948, when over 90% of those queried

expressed themselves as opposed to the purchase of common

stocks.^3 About half gave as their reason “not safe, a gamble,” and

about half, the reason “not familiar with.” * It is indeed ironical

```
Investment versus Speculation 19
```
* The survey Graham cites was conducted for the Fed by the University of

Michigan and was published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin,July, 1948.

People were asked, “Suppose a man decides not to spend his money. He

can either put it in a bank or in bonds or he can invest it. What do you think

would be the wisest thing for him to do with the money nowadays—put it in

the bank, buy savings bonds with it, invest it in real estate, or buy common

stock with it?” Only 4% thought common stock would offer a “satisfactory”

return; 26% considered it “not safe” or a “gamble.” From 1949 through

1958, the stock market earned one of its highest 10-year returns in history,


(though not surprising) that common-stock purchases of all kinds

were quite generally regarded as highly speculative or risky at a

time when they were selling on a most attractive basis, and due

soon to begin their greatest advance in history; conversely the very

fact they had advanced to what were undoubtedly dangerous lev-

els as judged by _past experience_ later transformed them into “invest-

ments,” and the entire stock-buying public into “investors.”

```
The distinction between investment and speculation in common
```
stocks has always been a useful one and its disappearance is a

cause for concern. We have often said that Wall Street as an institu-

tion would be well advised to reinstate this distinction and to

emphasize it in all its dealings with the public. Otherwise the stock

exchanges may some day be blamed for heavy speculative losses,

which those who suffered them had not been properly warned

against. Ironically, once more, much of the recent financial embar-

rassment of some stock-exchange firms seems to have come from

the inclusion of speculative common stocks in their own capital

funds. We trust that the reader of this book will gain a reasonably

clear idea of the risks that are inherent in common-stock commit-

ments—risks which are inseparable from the opportunities of

profit that they offer, and both of which must be allowed for in the

investor’s calculations.

```
What we have just said indicates that there may no longer be
```
such a thing as a simon-pure investment policy comprising repre-

sentative common stocks—in the sense that one can always wait to

buy them at a price that involves no risk of a market or “quota-

tional” loss large enough to be disquieting. In most periods the

investor must recognize the existence of a _speculative factor_ in his

common-stock holdings. It is his task to keep this component

within minor limits, and to be prepared financially and psycholog-

ically for adverse results that may be of short or long duration.

neither illegal, immoral, nor (for most people) fattening to the

pocketbook. More than that, some speculation is necessary and

unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are sub-

stantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein

must be assumed by someone.* There is intelligent speculation as

there is intelligent investing. But there are many ways in which

speculation may be unintelligent. Of these the foremost are: (1)

speculating when you think you are investing; (2) speculating seri-

ously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge

and skill for it; and (3) risking more money in speculation than you

can afford to lose.

In our conservative view every nonprofessional who operates

is his broker’s duty so to advise him. And everyone who buys a

so-called “hot” common-stock issue, or makes a purchase in any

way similar thereto, is either speculating or gambling. Speculation

is always fascinating, and it can be a lot of fun while you are ahead

of the game. If you want to try your luck at it, put aside a portion—

the smaller the better—of your capital in a separate fund for this

purpose. Never add more money to this account just because the

new companies (like Amazon.com or, in earlier times, the Edison Electric

The alluring, long-shot chance of a huge gain is the grease that lubricates

the machinery of innovation. Secondly, risk is exchanged (but never elimi-

nated) every time a stock is bought or sold. The buyer purchases the primary

risk that this stock may go down. Meanwhile, the seller still retains a residual

risk—the chance that the stock he just sold may go up!

must put up more money if that value falls below the amount you borrowed.

```
Results to Be Expected by the Defensive Investor
```
```
We have already defined the defensive investor as one inter-
ested chiefly in safety plus freedom from bother. In general what
course should he follow and what return can he expect under
“average normal conditions”—if such conditions really exist? To
answer these questions we shall consider first what we wrote on
the subject seven years ago, next what significant changes have
occurred since then in the underlying factors governing the
investor’s expectable return, and finally what he should do and
what he should expect under present-day (early 1972) conditions.
```
_1. What We Said Six Years Ago_

```
We recommended that the investor divide his holdings between
high-grade bonds and leading common stocks; that the proportion
held in bonds be never less than 25% or more than 75%, with the
converse being necessarily true for the common-stock component;
that his simplest choice would be to maintain a 50–50 proportion
between the two, with adjustments to restore the equality when
market developments had disturbed it by as much as, say, 5%. As
an alternative policy he might choose to reduce his common-stock
component to 25% “if he felt the market was dangerously high,”
and conversely to advance it toward the maximum of 75% “if he
felt that a decline in stock prices was making them increasingly
attractive.”
In 1965 the investor could obtain about 4^1 ⁄ 2 % on high-grade tax-
able bonds and 3^1 ⁄ 4 % on good tax-free bonds. The dividend return
```
on leading common stocks (with the DJIA at 892) was only about

3.2%. This fact, and others, suggested caution. We implied that “at

normal levels of the market” the investor should be able to obtain

an initial dividend return of between 3^1 ⁄ 2 % and 4^1 ⁄ 2 % on his stock

```
purchases, to which should be added a steady increase in underly-
ing value (and in the “normal market price”) of a representative
```
```
22 The Intelligent Investor
```

```
stock list of about the same amount, giving a return from divi-
dends and appreciation combined of about 7^1 ⁄ 2 % per year. The half
```
and half division between bonds and stocks would yield about 6%

before income tax. We added that the stock component should

carry a fair degree of protection against a loss of purchasing power

caused by large-scale inflation.

```
It should be pointed out that the above arithmetic indicated
```
expectation of a much lower rate of advance in the stock market

than had been realized between 1949 and 1964. That rate had aver-

aged a good deal better than 10% for listed stocks as a whole, and it

was quite generally regarded as a sort of guarantee that similarly

satisfactory results could be counted on in the future. Few people

were willing to consider seriously the possibility that the high rate

of advance in the past means that stock prices are “now too high,”

and hence that “the wonderful results since 1949 would imply not

very good but _bad_ results for the future.”^4

_2. What Has Happened Since 1964_

```
The major change since 1964 has been the rise in interest rates on
first-grade bonds to record high levels, although there has since
been a considerable recovery from the lowest prices of 1970. The
obtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 7^1 ⁄ 2 % and
```
even more against 4^1 ⁄ 2 % in 1964. In the meantime the dividend

```
return on DJIA-type stocks had a fair advance also during the mar-
ket decline of 1969–70, but as we write (with “the Dow” at 900) it is
less than 3.5% against 3.2% at the end of 1964. The change in going
interest rates produced a maximum decline of about 38% in the
market price of medium-term (say 20-year) bonds during this
period.
There is a paradoxical aspect to these developments. In 1964 we
discussed at length the possibility that the price of stocks might be
too high and subject ultimately to a serious decline; but we did not
consider specifically the possibility that the same might happen to
the price of high-grade bonds. (Neither did anyone else that we
know of.) We did warn (on p. 90) that “a long-term bond may vary
widely in price in response to changes in interest rates.” In the light
of what has since happened we think that this warning—with
attendant examples—was insufficiently stressed. For the fact is that
```
```
Investment versus Speculation 23
```

if the investor had a given sum in the DJIA at its closing price of

874 in 1964 he would have had a small profit thereon in late 1971;

even at the lowest level (631) in 1970 his indicated loss would have

been less than that shown on good long-term bonds. On the other

hand, if he had confined his bond-type investments to U.S. savings

bonds, short-term corporate issues, or savings accounts, he would

have had no loss in market value of his principal during this period

and he would have enjoyed a higher income return than was

offered by good stocks. It turned out, therefore, that true “cash

equivalents” proved to be better investments in 1964 than common

stocks—in spite of the inflation experience that in theory should

have favored stocks over cash. The decline in quoted principal

value of good longer-term bonds was due to developments in the

money market, an abstruse area which ordinarily does not have an

important bearing on the investment policy of individuals.

```
This is just another of an endless series of experiences over time
```
that have demonstrated that the future of security prices is never

predictable.* Almost always bonds have fluctuated much less than

stock prices, and investors generally could buy good bonds of any

maturity without having to worry about changes in their market

value. There were a few exceptions to this rule, and the period after

1964 proved to be one of them. We shall have more to say about

change in bond prices in a later chapter.

_3. Expectations and Policy in Late 1971 and Early 1972_

```
Toward the end of 1971 it was possible to obtain 8% taxable
```
interest on good medium-term corporate bonds, and 5.7% tax-free

on good state or municipal securities. In the shorter-term field the

investor could realize about 6% on U.S. government issues due in

five years. In the latter case the buyer need not be concerned about

_24 The Intelligent Investor_

* Read Graham’s sentence again, and note what this greatest of investing

experts is saying: The future of security prices is never predictable. And as

you read ahead in the book, notice how everything else Graham tells you is

designed to help you grapple with that truth. Since you cannot predict the

behavior of the markets, you must learn how to predict and control your own

behavior.


```
a possible loss in market value, since he is sure of full repayment,
including the 6% interest return, at the end of a comparatively
short holding period. The DJIA at its recurrent price level of 900 in
1971 yields only 3.5%.
Let us assume that now, as in the past, the basic policy decision
to be made is how to divide the fund between high-grade bonds
(or other so-called “cash equivalents”) and leading DJIA-type
stocks. What course should the investor follow under present con-
ditions, if we have no strong reason to predict either a significant
upward or a significant downward movement for some time in the
future? First let us point out that if there is no serious adverse
change, the defensive investor should be able to count on the cur-
rent 3.5% dividend return on his stocks and also on an average
annual appreciation of about 4%. As we shall explain later this
appreciation is based essentially on the reinvestment by the vari-
ous companies of a corresponding amount annually out of undis-
tributed profits. On a before-tax basis the combined return of his
stocks would then average, say, 7.5%, somewhat less than his inter-
est on high-grade bonds.* On an after-tax basis the average return
on stocks would work out at some 5.3%.^5 This would be about the
```
same as is now obtainable on good tax-free medium-term bonds.

```
These expectations are much less favorable for stocks against
```
bonds than they were in our 1964 analysis. (That conclusion fol-

lows inevitably from the basic fact that bond yields have gone up

much more than stock yields since 1964.) We must never lose sight

```
Investment versus Speculation 25
```
```
* How well did Graham’s forecast pan out? At first blush, it seems, very
well: From the beginning of 1972 through the end of 1981, stocks earned
an annual average return of 6.5%. (Graham did not specify the time period
for his forecast, but it’s plausible to assume that he was thinking of a 10-
year time horizon.) However, inflation raged at 8.6% annually over this
period, eating up the entire gain that stocks produced. In this section of his
chapter, Graham is summarizing what is known as the “Gordon equation,”
which essentially holds that the stock market’s future return is the sum of the
current dividend yield plus expected earnings growth. With a dividend yield
of just under 2% in early 2003, and long-term earnings growth of around
2%, plus inflation at a bit over 2%, a future average annual return of roughly
6% is plausible. (See the commentary on Chapter 3.)
```

of the fact that the interest and principal payments on good bonds

are much better protected and therefore more certain than the divi-

dends and price appreciation on stocks. Consequently we are

forced to the conclusion that now, toward the end of 1971, bond

investment appears clearly preferable to stock investment. If we

could be sure that this conclusion is right we would have to advise

the defensive investor to put _all_ his money in bonds and _none_ in

common stocks until the current yield relationship changes signifi-

cantly in favor of stocks.

```
But of course we cannot be certain that bonds will work out bet-
```
ter than stocks from today’s levels. The reader will immediately

think of the inflation factor as a potent reason on the other side. In

the next chapter we shall argue that our considerable experience

with inflation in the United States during this century would not

support the choice of stocks against bonds at present differentials

in yield. But there is always the possibility—though we consider it

remote—of an accelerating inflation, which in one way or another

would have to make stock equities preferable to bonds payable in a

fixed amount of dollars.* There is the alternative possibility—

which we also consider highly unlikely—that American business

will become so profitable, without stepped-up inflation, as to jus-

tify a large increase in common-stock values in the next few years.

Finally, there is the more familiar possibility that we shall witness

another great speculative rise in the stock market without a real

justification in the underlying values. Any of these reasons, and

perhaps others we haven’t thought of, _might_ cause the investor to

regret a 100% concentration on bonds even at their more favorable

yield levels.

```
Hence, after this foreshortened discussion of the major consider-
```
ations, we once again enunciate the same basic compromise policy

_26 The Intelligent Investor_

* Since 1997, when Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (or TIPS) were

introduced, stocks have no longer been the automatically superior choice

for investors who expect inflation to increase. TIPS, unlike other bonds, rise

in value if the Consumer Price Index goes up, effectively immunizing the

investor against losing money after inflation. Stocks carry no such guarantee

and, in fact, are a relatively poor hedge against high rates of inflation. (For

more details, see the commentary to Chapter 2.)


for defensive investors—namely that at all times they have a signif-

icant part of their funds in bond-type holdings and a significant

part also in equities. It is still true that they may choose between

maintaining a simple 50–50 division between the two components

or a ratio, dependent on their judgment, varying between a mini-

mum of 25% and a maximum of 75% of either. We shall give our

more detailed view of these alternative policies in a later chapter.

```
Since at present the overall return envisaged from common stocks
```
is nearly the same as that from bonds, the presently expectable

return (including growth of stock values) for the investor would

change little regardless of how he divides his fund between the

two components. As calculated above, the aggregate return from

both parts should be about 7.8% before taxes or 5.5% on a tax-free

(or estimated tax-paid) basis. A return of this order is appreciably

higher than that realized by the typical conservative investor over

most of the long-term past. It may not seem attractive in relation to

the 14%, or so, return shown by common stocks during the 20

years of the predominantly bull market after 1949. But it should be

remembered that between 1949 and 1969 the price of the DJIA had

advanced more than fivefold while its earnings and dividends had

about doubled. Hence the greater part of the impressive market

record for that period was based on a change in investors’ and

speculators’ attitudes rather than in underlying corporate values.

To that extent it might well be called a “bootstrap operation.”

```
In discussing the common-stock portfolio of the defensive
```
investor, we have spoken only of leading issues of the type

included in the 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-

age. We have done this for convenience, and not to imply that these

30 issues alone are suitable for purchase by him. Actually, there are

many other companies of quality equal to or excelling the average

of the Dow Jones list; these would include a host of public utilities

(which have a separate Dow Jones average to represent them).* But

```
Investment versus Speculation 27
```
* Today, the most widely available alternatives to the Dow Jones Industrial

Average are the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index (the “S & P”) and the

Wilshire 5000 index. The S & P focuses on 500 large, well-known compa-

nies that make up roughly 70% of the total value of the U.S. equity market.

The Wilshire 5000 follows the returns of nearly every significant, publicly


the major point here is that the defensive investor’s overall results

are not likely to be decisively different from one diversified or rep-

resentative list than from another, or—more accurately—that nei-

ther he nor his advisers could predict with certainty whatever

differences would ultimately develop. It is true that the art of skill-

ful or shrewd investment is supposed to lie particularly in the

selection of issues that will give better results than the general mar-

ket. For reasons to be developed elsewhere we are skeptical of the

ability of defensive investors generally to get better than average

results—which in fact would mean to beat their own overall per-

formance.* (Our skepticism extends to the management of large

funds by experts.)

```
Let us illustrate our point by an example that at first may seem
```
to prove the opposite. Between December 1960 and December 1970

the DJIA advanced from 616 to 839, or 36%. But in the same period

the much larger Standard & Poor’s weighted index of 500 stocks

rose from 58.11 to 92.15, or 58%. Obviously the second group had

proved a better “buy” than the first. But who would have been so

rash as to predict in 1960 that what seemed like a miscellaneous

assortment of all sorts of common stocks would definitely outper-

form the aristocratic “thirty tyrants” of the Dow? All this proves,

we insist, that only rarely can one make dependable predictions

about price changes, absolute or relative.

```
We shall repeat here without apology—for the warning cannot
```
be given too often—that the investor cannot hope for better than

average results by buying new offerings, or “hot” issues of any

sort, meaning thereby those recommended for a quick profit.† The

contrary is almost certain to be true in the long run. The defensive

investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies

with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial

condition. (Any security analyst worth his salt could make up such

_28 The Intelligent Investor_

traded stock in America, roughly 6,700 in all; but, since the largest compa-

nies account for most of the total value of the index, the return of the

Wilshire 5000 is usually quite similar to that of the S & P 500. Several low-

cost mutual funds enable investors to hold the stocks in these indexes as a

single, convenient portfolio. (See Chapter 9.)

* See pp. 363–366 and pp. 376–380.

```
a list.) Aggressive investors may buy other types of common
stocks, but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as estab-
lished by intelligent analysis.
To conclude this section, let us mention briefly three supplemen-
tary concepts or practices for the defensive investor. The first is the
purchase of the shares of well-established investment funds as an
alternative to creating his own common-stock portfolio. He might
also utilize one of the “common trust funds,” or “commingled
funds,” operated by trust companies and banks in many states; or,
if his funds are substantial, use the services of a recognized invest-
ment-counsel firm. This will give him professional administration
of his investment program along standard lines. The third is the
device of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that the
practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars
each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when
the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up
with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings. Strictly speak-
ing, this method is an application of a broader approach known as
“formula investing.” The latter was already alluded to in our sug-
gestion that the investor may vary his holdings of common stocks
between the 25% minimum and the 75% maximum, in inverse rela-
tionship to the action of the market. These ideas have merit for the
defensive investor, and they will be discussed more amply in later
chapters.*
```
```
Results to Be Expected by the Aggressive Investor
```
```
Our enterprising security buyer, of course, will desire and
```
expect to attain better overall results than his defensive or passive

companion. But first he must make sure that his results will not be

worse. It is no difficult trick to bring a great deal of energy, study,

and native ability into Wall Street and to end up with losses instead

of profits. These virtues, if channeled in the wrong directions,

become indistinguishable from handicaps. Thus it is most essential

that the enterprising investor start with a clear conception as to

```
Investment versus Speculation 29
```
```
* For more advice on “well-established investment funds,” see Chapter 9.
“Professional administration” by “a recognized investment-counsel firm” is
discussed in Chapter 10. “Dollar-cost averaging” is explained in Chapter 5.
```

which courses of action offer reasonable chances of success and

which do not.

```
First let us consider several ways in which investors and specu-
```
lators generally have endeavored to obtain better than average

results. These include:

```
1.Trading in the market.This usually means buying stocks
```
when the market has been advancing and selling them after it has

turned downward. The stocks selected are likely to be among those

which have been “behaving” better than the market average. A

small number of professionals frequently engage in short selling.

Here they will sell issues they do not own but borrow through the

established mechanism of the stock exchanges. Their object is to

benefit from a subsequent decline in the price of these issues, by

buying them back at a price lower than they sold them for. (As our

quotation from the _Wall Street Journal_ on p. 19 indicates, even

“small investors”—perish the term!—sometimes try their unskilled

hand at short selling.)

```
2.Short-term selectivity.This means buying stocks of compa-
```
nies which are reporting or expected to report increased earnings,

or for which some other favorable development is anticipated.

```
3.Long-term selectivity. Here the usual emphasis is on an
```
excellent record of past growth, which is considered likely to con-

tinue in the future. In some cases also the “investor” may choose

companies which have not yet shown impressive results, but are

expected to establish a high earning power later. (Such companies

belong frequently in some technological area—e.g., computers,

drugs, electronics—and they often are developing new processes

or products that are deemed to be especially promising.)

```
We have already expressed a negative view about the investor’s
```
overall chances of success in these areas of activity. The first we

have ruled out, on both theoretical and realistic grounds, from the

domain of investment. Stock trading is not an operation “which, on

thorough analysis, offers safety of principal and a satisfactory

return.” More will be said on stock trading in a later chapter.*

_30 The Intelligent Investor_

* See Chapter 8.


```
In his endeavor to select the most promising stocks either for the
```
near term or the longer future, the investor faces obstacles of two

kinds—the first stemming from human fallibility and the second

from the nature of his competition. He may be wrong in his esti-

mate of the future; or even if he is right, the current market price

may already fully reflect what he is anticipating. In the area of

near-term selectivity, the current year’s results of the company are

generally common property on Wall Street; next year’s results, to

the extent they are predictable, are already being carefully consid-

ered. Hence the investor who selects issues chiefly on the basis of

this year’s superior results, or on what he is told he may expect for

next year, is likely to find that others have done the same thing for

the same reason.

```
In choosing stocks for their long-term prospects, the investor’s
```
handicaps are basically the same. The possibility of outright error

in the prediction—which we illustrated by our airlines example on

p. 6—is no doubt greater than when dealing with near-term earn-

ings. Because the experts frequently go astray in such forecasts, it is

theoretically possible for an investor to benefit greatly by making

correct predictions when Wall Street as a whole is making incorrect

ones. But that is only theoretical. How many enterprising investors

could count on having the acumen or prophetic gift to beat the pro-

fessional analysts at their favorite game of estimating long-term

future earnings?

```
We are thus led to the following logical if disconcerting conclu-
sion: To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average
results, the investor must follow policies which are (1) inherently
sound and promising, and (2) not popular on Wall Street.
Are there any such policies available for the enterprising
investor? In theory once again, the answer should be yes; and there
are broad reasons to think that the answer should be affirmative in
practice as well. Everyone knows that speculative stock move-
ments are carried too far in both directions, frequently in the gen-
eral market and at all times in at least some of the individual
issues. Furthermore, a common stock may be undervalued because
of lack of interest or unjustified popular prejudice. We can go fur-
ther and assert that in an astonishingly large proportion of the
trading in common stocks, those engaged therein don’t appear to
know—in polite terms—one part of their anatomy from another. In
this book we shall point out numerous examples of (past) dis-
```
```
Investment versus Speculation 31
```

crepancies between price and value. Thus it seems that any intelli-

gent person, with a good head for figures, should have a veritable

picnic on Wall Street, battening off other people’s foolishness. So it

seems, but somehow it doesn’t work out that simply. Buying a neg-

lected and therefore undervalued issue for profit generally proves

a protracted and patience-trying experience. And selling short a

too popular and therefore overvalued issue is apt to be a test not

only of one’s courage and stamina but also of the depth of one’s

pocketbook.* The principle is sound, its successful application is

not impossible, but it is distinctly not an easy art to master.

```
There is also a fairly wide group of “special situations,” which
```
over many years could be counted on to bring a nice annual return

of 20% or better, with a minimum of overall risk to those who knew

their way around in this field. They include intersecurity arbi-

trages, payouts or workouts in liquidations, protected hedges of

certain kinds. The most typical case is a projected merger or acqui-

sition which offers a substantially higher value for certain shares

than their price on the date of the announcement. The number of

such deals increased greatly in recent years, and it should have

been a highly profitable period for the cognoscenti. But with the

multiplication of merger announcements came a multiplication of

obstacles to mergers and of deals that didn’t go through; quite a

few individual losses were thus realized in these once-reliable

operations. Perhaps, too, the overall rate of profit was diminished

by too much competition.†

_32 The Intelligent Investor_

* In “selling short” (or “shorting”) a stock, you make a bet that its share

price will go down, not up. Shorting is a three-step process: First, you bor-

row shares from someone who owns them; then you immediately sell the

borrowed shares; finally, you replace them with shares you buy later. If the

stock drops, you will be able to buy your replacement shares at a lower

price. The difference between the price at which you sold your borrowed

shares and the price you paid for the replacement shares is your gross profit

(reduced by dividend or interest charges, along with brokerage costs). How-

ever, if the stock goes up in price instead of down, your potential loss is

unlimited—making short sales unacceptably speculative for most individual

investors.

† In the late 1980s, as hostile corporate takeovers and leveraged buyouts

multiplied, Wall Street set up institutional arbitrage desks to profit from any


```
The lessened profitability of these special situations appears one
```
manifestation of a kind of self-destructive process—akin to the law

of diminishing returns—which has developed during the lifetime

of this book. In 1949 we could present a study of stock-market fluc-

tuations over the preceding 75 years, which supported a formula—

based on earnings and current interest rates—for determining a

level to buy the DJIA below its “central” or “intrinsic” value,

and to sell out above such value. It was an application of the gov-

erning maxim of the Rothschilds: “Buy cheap and sell dear.” * And

it had the advantage of running directly counter to the ingrained

and pernicious maxim of Wall Street that stocks should be bought

because they have gone up and sold because they have gone down.

Alas, after 1949 this formula no longer worked. A second illustra-

tion is provided by the famous “Dow Theory” of stock-market

movements, in a comparison of its indicated splendid results for

1897–1933 and its much more questionable performance since

1934.

```
A third and final example of the golden opportunities not
```
recently available: A good part of our own operations on Wall

Street had been concentrated on the purchase of _bargain issues_ eas-

ily identified as such by the fact that they were selling at less than

their share in the net current assets (working capital) alone, not

counting the plant account and other assets, and after deducting all

liabilities ahead of the stock. It is clear that these issues were selling

at a price well below the value of the enterprise as a private busi-

ness. No proprietor or majority holder would think of selling what

he owned at so ridiculously low a figure. Strangely enough, such

```
Investment versus Speculation 33
```
```
errors in pricing these complex deals. They became so good at it that the
easy profits disappeared and many of these desks have been closed down.
Although Graham does discuss it again (see pp. 174–175), this sort of trad-
ing is no longer feasible or appropriate for most people, since only multi-
million-dollar trades are large enough to generate worthwhile profits.
Wealthy individuals and institutions can utilize this strategy through hedge
funds that specialize in merger or “event” arbitrage.
* The Rothschild family, led by Nathan Mayer Rothschild, was the dominant
power in European investment banking and brokerage in the nineteenth
century. For a brilliant history, see Niall Ferguson, The House of Rothschild:
Money’s Prophets, 1798–1848(Viking, 1998).
```

anomalies were not hard to find. In 1957 a list was published show-

ing nearly 200 issues of this type available in the market. In various

ways practically all these bargain issues turned out to be profitable,

and the average annual result proved much more remunerative

than most other investments. But they too virtually disappeared

from the stock market in the next decade, and with them a depend-

able area for shrewd and successful operation by the enterprising

investor. However, at the low prices of 1970 there again appeared a

considerable number of such “sub-working-capital” issues, and

despite the strong recovery of the market, enough of them

remained at the end of the year to make up a full-sized portfolio.

```
The enterprising investor under today’s conditions still has vari-
```
ous possibilities of achieving better than average results. The huge

list of marketable securities must include a fair number that can be

identified as undervalued by logical and reasonably dependable

standards. These should yield more satisfactory results on the

average than will the DJIA or any similarly representative list. In

our view the search for these would not be worth the investor’s

effort unless he could hope to add, say, 5% before taxes to the aver-

age annual return from the stock portion of his portfolio. We shall

try to develop one or more such approaches to stock selection for

use by the active investor.

**COMMENTARY ON CHAPTER 1**

```
All of human unhappiness comes from one single thing: not
knowing how to remain at rest in a room.
—Blaise Pascal
```
Why do you suppose the brokers on the floor of the New York Stock

Exchange always cheer at the sound of the closing bell—no matter

what the market did that day? Because whenever you trade, they

make money—whether you did or not. By speculating instead of invest-

ing, you lower your own odds of building wealth and raise someone

else’s.

```
Graham’s definition of investing could not be clearer: “An invest-
```
ment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety

of principal and an adequate return.”^1 Note that investing, according to

```
Graham, consists equally of three elements:
```
- you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its
    underlying businesses, before you buy its stock;
- you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses;
- you must aspire to “adequate,” not extraordinary, performance.

### 35

(^1) Graham goes even further, fleshing out each of the key terms in his defini-
tion: “thorough analysis” means “the study of the facts in the light of estab-
lished standards of safety and value” while “safety of principal” signifies
“protection against loss under all normal or reasonably likely conditions or
variations” and “adequate” (or “satisfactory”) return refers to “any rate or
amount of return, however low, which the investor is willing to accept, pro-
vided he acts with reasonable intelligence.” (Security Analysis,1934 ed.,
pp. 55–56).


```
An investor calculates what a stock is worth, based on the value of
```
its businesses. A speculator gambles that a stock will go up in price

because somebody else will pay even more for it. As Graham once

put it, investors judge “the market price by established standards of

value,” while speculators “base [their] standards of value upon the

market price.”^2 For a speculator, the incessant stream of stock quotes

```
is like oxygen; cut it off and he dies. For an investor, what Graham
called “quotational” values matter much less. Graham urges you to
invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had
no way of knowing its daily share price.^3
Like casino gambling or betting on the horses, speculating in the
```
market can be exciting or even rewarding (if you happen to get lucky).

But it’s the worst imaginable way to build your wealth. That’s because

Wall Street, like Las Vegas or the racetrack, has calibrated the odds

so that the house always prevails, in the end, against everyone who

tries to beat the house at its own speculative game.

```
On the other hand, investingis a unique kind of casino—one where
```
you cannot lose in the end, so long as you play only by the rules that

put the odds squarely in your favor. People who investmake money for

themselves; people who speculatemake money for their brokers. And

that, in turn, is why Wall Street perennially downplays the durable

virtues of investing and hypes the gaudy appeal of speculation.

**UNSAFE AT HIGH SPEED**

Confusing speculation with investment, Graham warns, is always a

mistake. In the 1990s, that confusion led to mass destruction. Almost

everyone, it seems, ran out of patience at once, and America became

the Speculation Nation, populated with traders who went shooting

from stock to stock like grasshoppers whizzing around in an August

hay field.

```
People began believing that the test of an investment technique
```
was simply whether it “worked.” If they beat the market over any

(^3) As Graham advised in an interview, “Ask yourself: If there was no market
for these shares, would I be willing to have an investment in this company on
these terms?” (Forbes,January 1, 1972, p. 90.)


period, no matter how dangerous or dumb their tactics, people

boasted that they were “right.” But the intelligent investor has no inter-

est in being temporarily right. To reach your long-term financial goals,

you must be sustainably and reliably right. The techniques that

became so trendy in the 1990s—day trading, ignoring diversification,

flipping hot mutual funds, following stock-picking “systems”—seemed

to work. But they had no chance of prevailing in the long run, because

they failed to meet all three of Graham’s criteria for investing.

```
To see why temporarily high returns don’t prove anything, imagine
```
that two places are 130 miles apart. If I observe the 65-mph speed

limit, I can drive that distance in two hours. But if I drive 130 mph, I

can get there in one hour. If I try this and survive, am I “right”? Should

you be tempted to try it, too, because you hear me bragging that it

“worked”? Flashy gimmicks for beating the market are much the

same: In short streaks, so long as your luck holds out, they work. Over

time, they will get you killed.

```
In 1973, when Graham last revised The Intelligent Investor,the
```
annual turnover rate on the New York Stock Exchange was 20%,

meaning that the typical shareholder held a stock for five years before

selling it. By 2002, the turnover rate had hit 105%—a holding period of

only 11.4 months. Back in 1973, the average mutual fund held on to a

stock for nearly three years; by 2002, that ownership period had

shrunk to just 10.9 months. It’s as if mutual-fund managers were

studying their stocks just long enough to learn they shouldn’t have

bought them in the first place, then promptly dumping them and start-

ing all over.

```
Even the most respected money-management firms got antsy. In
```
early 1995, Jeffrey Vinik, manager of Fidelity Magellan (then the

world’s largest mutual fund), had 42.5% of its assets in technology

stocks. Vinik proclaimed that most of his shareholders “have invested

in the fund for goals that are years away....I think their objectives are

the same as mine, and that they believe, as I do, that a long-term

approach is best.” But six months after he wrote those high-minded

words, Vinik sold off almost all his technology shares, unloading nearly

$19 billion worth in eight frenzied weeks. So much for the “long term”!

And by 1999, Fidelity’s discount brokerage division was egging on its

clients to trade anywhere, anytime, using a Palm handheld computer—

which was perfectly in tune with the firm’s new slogan, “Every second

counts.”

And on the NASDAQ exchange, turnover hit warp speed, as Fig-

In 1999, shares in Puma Technology, for instance, changed hands
an average of once every 5.7 days. Despite NASDAQ’s grandiose
motto—“The Stock Market for the Next Hundred Years”—many of its
customers could barely hold on to a stock for a hundred hours.

Morgan Stanley, ran a TV commercial in which a scruffy tow-truck
driver picks up a prosperous-looking executive. Spotting a photo of a
tropical beachfront posted on the dashboard, the executive asks,
“Vacation?” “Actually,” replies the driver, “that’s my home.” Taken
aback, the suit says, “Looks like an island.” With quiet triumph, the
driver answers, “Technically, it’s a country.”
The propaganda went further. Online trading would take no work
and require no thought. A television ad from Ameritrade, the online
broker, showed two housewives just back from jogging; one logs on
to her computer, clicks the mouse a few times, and exults, “I think I just
made about $1,700!” In a TV commercial for the Waterhouse broker-
age firm, someone asked basketball coach Phil Jackson, “You know
anything about the trade?” His answer: “I’m going to make it right
now.” (How many games would Jackson’s NBA teams have won if he
had brought that philosophy to courtside? Somehow, knowing noth-
ing about the other team, but saying, “I’m ready to play them right
now,” doesn’t sound like a championship formula.)
By 1999 at least six million people were trading online—and roughly
a tenth of them were “day trading,” using the Internet to buy and sell
stocks at lightning speed. Everyone from showbiz diva Barbra
Streisand to Nicholas Birbas, a 25-year-old former waiter in Queens,
New York, was flinging stocks around like live coals. “Before,” scoffed
Birbas, “I was investing for the long term and I found out that it was not
smart.” Now, Birbas traded stocks up to 10 times a day and expected
to earn $100,000 in a year. “I can’t stand to see red in my profit-or-loss
column,” Streisand shuddered in an interview with Fortune.“I’m Taurus

Juno announced that it would henceforth offer all its retail services for

would spend millions of dollars more on advertising over the next year.
On this declaration of corporate hara-kiri, Juno’s stock roared up from

faster, without the pesky two-second delay of looking them up on an
Internet search engine. In late 1998, the stock of a tiny, rarely traded
building-maintenance company, Temco Services, nearly tripled in a

FROM FORMULA TO FIASCO
```
```
But trading as if your underpants are on fire is not the only form of
speculation. Throughout the past decade or so, one speculative for-
mula after another was promoted, popularized, and then thrown aside.
All of them shared a few traits—This is quick! This is easy! And it won’t
hurt a bit!—and all of them violated at least one of Graham’s distinc-
tions between investing and speculating. Here are a few of the trendy
formulas that fell flat:
```
- Cash in on the calendar.The “January effect”—the tendency of
    small stocks to produce big gains around the turn of the year—
    was widely promoted in scholarly articles and popular books pub-
    lished in the 1980s. These studies showed that if you piled into
    small stocks in the second half of December and held them into
    January, you would beat the market by five to 10 percentage
    points. That amazed many experts. After all, if it were this easy,
    surely everyone would hear about it, lots of people would do it,
    and the opportunity would wither away.
       What caused the January jolt? First of all, many investors sell
    their crummiest stocks late in the year to lock in losses that can
    cut their tax bills. Second, professional money managers grow
    more cautious as the year draws to a close, seeking to preserve
    their outperformance (or minimize their underperformance). That
    makes them reluctant to buy (or even hang on to) a falling stock.
    And if an underperforming stock is also small and obscure, a
    money manager will be even less eager to show it in his year-end

```
Commentary on Chapter 1 41

```
list of holdings. All these factors turn small stocks into momentary
bargains; when the tax-driven selling ceases in January, they typi-
cally bounce back, producing a robust and rapid gain.
The January effect has not withered away, but it has weakened.
According to finance professor William Schwert of the University of
Rochester, if you had bought small stocks in late December and
sold them in early January, you would have beaten the market by 8.5
percentage points from 1962 through 1979, by 4.4 points from
1980 through 1989, and by 5.8 points from 1990 through 2001.^10
As more people learned about the January effect, more traders
bought small stocks in December, making them less of a bargain
and thus reducing their returns. Also, the January effect is biggest
among the smallest stocks—but according to Plexus Group, the
leading authority on brokerage expenses, the total cost of buying
and selling such tiny stocks can run up to 8% of your invest-
ment.^11 Sadly, by the time you’re done paying your broker, all your
gains on the January effect will melt away.

- Just do “what works.”In 1996, an obscure money manager
    named James O’Shaughnessy published a book called What
    Works on Wall Street.In it, he argued that “investors can do
    much betterthan the market.” O’Shaughnessy made a stunning
    claim: From 1954 through 1994, you could have turned $10,000
    into $8,074,504, beating the market by more than 10-fold—a tow-
    ering 18.2% average annual return. How? By buying a basket of
    50 stocks with the highest one-year returns, five straight years of
    rising earnings, and share prices less than 1.5 times their corpo-
    rate revenues.^12 As if he were the Edison of Wall Street,
O’Shaughnessy obtained U.S. Patent No. 5,978,778 for his “auto-
mated strategies” and launched a group of four mutual funds
based on his findings. By late 1999 the funds had sucked in more
than $175 million from the public—and, in his annual letter to
shareholders, O’Shaughnessy stated grandly: “As always, I hope

that together, we can reach our long-term goals by staying the
course and sticking with our time-tested investment strategies.”
But “what works on Wall Street” stopped working right after
O’Shaughnessy publicized it. As Figure 1-2 shows, two of his
funds stank so badly that they shut down in early 2000, and the

```
overall stock market (as measured by the S & P 500 index) wal-
loped every O’Shaughnessy fund almost nonstop for nearly four
years running.
In June 2000, O’Shaughnessy moved closer to his own “long-
term goals” by turning the funds over to a new manager, leaving
his customers to fend for themselves with those “time-tested
investment strategies.”^13 O’Shaughnessy’s shareholders might
have been less upset if he had given his book a more precise
title—for instance, What Used to Work on Wall Street... Until I
Wrote This Book.

website (and several books) hyped the daylights out of a tech-
nique called “The Foolish Four.” According to the Motley Fool, you
would have “trashed the market averages over the last 25 years”
and could “crush your mutual funds” by spending “only 15 min-
utes a year” on planning your investments. Best of all, this tech-
nique had “minimal risk.” All you needed to do was this:
```
1. Take the five stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average with
    the lowest stock prices and highest dividend yields.
2. Discard the one with the lowest price.
3. Put 40% of your money in the stock with the second-lowest
    price.
4. Put 20% in each of the three remaining stocks.
5. One year later, sort the Dow the same way and reset the
    portfolio according to steps 1 through 4.
6. Repeat until wealthy.

```
Over a 25-year period, the Motley Fool claimed, this technique
would have beaten the market by a remarkable 10.1 percentage
```
```
44 Commentary on Chapter 1
```
(^13) In a remarkable irony, the surviving two O’Shaughnessy funds (now
known as the Hennessy funds) began performing quite well just as
O’Shaughnessy announced that he was turning over the management to
another company. The funds’ shareholders were furious. In a chat room at
[http://www.morningstar.com,](http://www.morningstar.com,) one fumed: “I guess ‘long term’ for O’S is 3 years.
...I feel your pain. I, too, had faith in O’S’s method....I had told several
friends and relatives about this fund, and now am glad they didn’t act on my
advice.”


```
points annually. Over the next two decades, they suggested,
$20,000 invested in The Foolish Four should flower into
$1,791,000. (And, they claimed, you could do still better by pick-
ing the five Dow stocks with the highest ratio of dividend yield to
the square root of stock price, dropping the one that scored the
highest, and buying the next four.)
Let’s consider whether this “strategy” could meet Graham’s
definitions of an investment:
```
- What kind of “thorough analysis” could justify discarding the
    stock with the single most attractive price and dividend—but
    keeping the four that score lower for those desirable qualities?
- How could putting 40% of your money into only one stock be a
    “minimal risk”?
- And how could a portfolio of only four stocks be diversified
    enough to provide “safety of principal”?

```
The Foolish Four, in short, was one of the most cockamamie
stock-picking formulas ever concocted. The Fools made the same
mistake as O’Shaughnessy: If you look at a large quantity of data
long enough, a huge number of patterns will emerge—if only by
chance. By random luck alone, the companies that produce
above-average stock returns will have plenty of things in common.
But unless those factors causethe stocks to outperform, they
can’t be used to predict future returns.
None of the factors that the Motley Fools “discovered” with
such fanfare—dropping the stock with the best score, doubling up
on the one with the second-highest score, dividing the dividend
yield by the square root of stock price—could possibly cause or
explain the future performance of a stock. MoneyMagazine found
that a portfolio made up of stocks whose names contained no
repeating letters would have performed nearly as well as The
Foolish Four—and for the same reason: luck alone.^14 As Graham
never stops reminding us, stocks do well or poorly in the future
because the businesses behind them do well or poorly—nothing
more, and nothing less.

```
Sure enough, instead of crushing the market, The Foolish Four
crushed the thousands of people who were fooled into believing
that it was a form of investing. In 2000 alone, the four Foolish
stocks—Caterpillar, Eastman Kodak, SBC, and General Motors—
lost 14% while the Dow dropped by just 4.7%.
```
```
As these examples show, there’s only one thing that never suffers a
```
bear market on Wall Street: dopey ideas. Each of these so-called

investing approaches fell prey to Graham’s Law. All mechanical formu-

las for earning higher stock performance are “a kind of self-destructive

process—akin to the law of diminishing returns.” There are two reasons

the returns fade away. If the formula was just based on random statis-

tical flukes (like The Foolish Four), the mere passage of time will

expose that it made no sense in the first place. On the other hand, if

the formula actually did work in the past (like the January effect), then

by publicizing it, market pundits always erode—and usually eliminate—

its ability to do so in the future.

```
All this reinforces Graham’s warning that you must treat specula-
```
tion as veteran gamblers treat their trips to the casino:

- You must never delude yourself into thinking that you’re investing

```
when you’re speculating.
```
- Speculating becomes mortally dangerous the moment you begin

```
to take it seriously.
```
- You must put strict limits on the amount you are willing to wager.

```
Just as sensible gamblers take, say, $100 down to the casino floor
```
and leave the rest of their money locked in the safe in their hotel room,

the intelligent investor designates a tiny portion of her total portfolio as

a “mad money” account. For most of us, 10% of our overall wealth is

the maximum permissible amount to put at speculative risk. Nevermin-

gle the money in your speculative account with what’s in your invest-

ment accounts; neverallow your speculative thinking to spill over into

your investing activities; and neverput more than 10% of your assets

into your mad money account, no matter what happens.

```
For better or worse, the gambling instinct is part of human nature—
```
so it’s futile for most people even to try suppressing it. But you must

confine and restrain it. That’s the single best way to make sure you will

never fool yourself into confusing speculation with investment.

CHAPTER 2

_The Investor and Inflation_

_I_ nflation, and the fight against it, has been very much in the

public’s mind in recent years. The shrinkage in the purchasing

power of the dollar in the past, and particularly the fear (or hope

by speculators) of a serious further decline in the future, has

greatly influenced the thinking of Wall Street. It is clear that those

with a fixed dollar income will suffer when the cost of living

advances, and the same applies to a fixed amount of dollar princi-

pal. Holders of stocks, on the other hand, have the possibility that a

loss of the dollar’s purchasing power may be offset by advances in

their dividends and the prices of their shares.

```
On the basis of these undeniable facts many financial authorities
```
have concluded that (1) bonds are an inherently undesirable form

of investment, and (2) consequently, common stocks are by their

very nature more desirable investments than bonds. We have

heard of charitable institutions being advised that their portfolios

should consist 100% of stocks and zero percent of bonds.* This is

quite a reversal from the earlier days when trust investments were

### 47

* By the late 1990s, this advice—which can be appropriate for a foundation

or endowment with an infinitely long investment horizon—had spread to indi-

vidual investors, whose life spans are finite. In the 1994 edition of his influ-

ential book, Stocks for the Long Run,finance professor Jeremy Siegel of the

Wharton School recommended that “risk-taking” investors should buy on

margin, borrowing more than a third of their net worth to sink 135% of their

assets into stocks. Even government officials got in on the act: In February

1999, the Honorable Richard Dixon, state treasurer of Maryland, told the

audience at an investment conference: “It doesn’t make any sense for any-

one to have any money in a bond fund.”


restricted by law to high-grade bonds (and a few choice preferred

stocks).

```
Our readers must have enough intelligence to recognize that
```
even high-quality stocks cannot be a better purchase than bonds

_under all conditions_ —i.e., regardless of how high the stock market

may be and how low the current dividend return compared with

the rates available on bonds. A statement of this kind would be as

absurd as was the contrary one—too often heard years ago—that

any bond is safer than any stock. In this chapter we shall try to

apply various measurements to the inflation factor, in order to

reach some conclusions as to the extent to which the investor may

wisely be influenced by expectations regarding future rises in the

price level.

```
In this matter, as in so many others in finance, we must base our
```
views of future policy on a knowledge of past experience. Is infla-

tion something new for this country, at least in the serious form it

has taken since 1965? If we have seen comparable (or worse) infla-

tions in living experience, what lessons can be learned from them

in confronting the inflation of today? Let us start with Table 2-1, a

condensed historical tabulation that contains much information

about changes in the general price level and concomitant changes

in the earnings and market value of common stocks. Our figures

will begin with 1915, and thus cover 55 years, presented at five-

year intervals. (We use 1946 instead of 1945 to avoid the last year of

wartime price controls.)

```
The first thing we notice is that we have had inflation in the
```
past—lots of it. The largest five-year dose was between 1915 and

1920, when the cost of living nearly doubled. This compares with

the advance of 15% between 1965 and 1970. In between, we have

had three periods of declining prices and then six of advances at

varying rates, some rather small. On this showing, the investor

should clearly allow for the probability of continuing or recurrent

inflation to come.

```
Can we tell what the rate of inflation is likely to be? No clear
```
answer is suggested by our table; it shows variations of all sorts. It

would seem sensible, however, to take our cue from the rather con-

sistent record of the past 20 years. The average annual rise in the

consumer price level for this period has been 2.5%; that for

1965–1970 was 4.5%; that for 1970 alone was 5.4%. Official govern-

ment policy has been strongly against large-scale inflation, and
there are some reasons to believe that Federal policies will be more
effective in the future than in recent years.* We think it would be
reasonable for an investor at this point to base his thinking and
decisions on a probable (far from certain) rate of future inflation of,
```
say, 3% per annum. (This would compare with an annual rate of

about 2^1 ⁄ 2 % for the entire period 1915–1970.)^1

```
What would be the implications of such an advance? It would
```
eat up, in higher living costs, about one-half the income now

obtainable on good medium-term tax-free bonds (or our assumed

after-tax equivalent from high-grade corporate bonds). This would

be a serious shrinkage, but it should not be exaggerated. It would

not mean that the true value, or the purchasing power, of the

investor’s fortune need be reduced over the years. If he spent half

his interest income after taxes he would maintain this buying

power intact, even against a 3% annual inflation.

```
But the next question, naturally, is, “Can the investor be reason-
```
ably sure of doing better by buying and holding other things than

high-grade bonds, even at the unprecedented rate of return offered

in 1970–1971?” Would not, for example, an all-stock program be

preferable to a part-bond, part-stock program? Do not common

stocks have a built-in protection against inflation, and are they not

almost certain to give a better return over the years than will

bonds? Have not in fact stocks treated the investor far better than

have bonds over the 55-year period of our study?

```
The answer to these questions is somewhat complicated. Com-
```
mon stocks have indeed done better than bonds over a long period

of time in the past. The rise of the DJIA from an average of 77 in

1915 to an average of 753 in 1970 works out at an annual com-

pounded rate of just about 4%, to which we may add another 4%

for average dividend return. (The corresponding figures for the

S & P composite are about the same.) These combined figures of 8%

```
50 The Intelligent Investor
```
```
* This is one of Graham’s rare misjudgments. In 1973, just two years after
President Richard Nixon imposed wage and price controls, inflation hit
8.7%, its highest level since the end of World War II. The decade from 1973
through 1982 was the most inflationary in modern American history, as the
cost of living more than doubled.
```

```
per year are of course much better than the return enjoyed from
bonds over the same 55-year period. But they do not exceed that
now offered by high-grade bonds. This brings us to the next logical
```
question: Is there a persuasive reason to believe that common

stocks are likely to do much better in future years than they have in

the last five and one-half decades?

```
Our answer to this crucial question must be a flat no. Common
```
stocks _may_ do better in the future than in the past, but they are far

```
from certain to do so. We must deal here with two different time
elements in investment results. The first covers what is likely to
occur over the long-term future—say, the next 25 years. The second
applies to what is likely to happen to the investor—both financially
and psychologically—over short or intermediate periods, say five
years or less. His frame of mind, his hopes and apprehensions, his
satisfaction or discontent with what he has done, above all his deci-
sions what to do next, are all determined not in the retrospect of
a lifetime of investment but rather by his experience from year
to year.
On this point we can be categorical. There is no close time con-
nection between inflationary (or deflationary) conditions and the
movement of common-stock earnings and prices. The obvious
example is the recent period, 1966–1970. The rise in the cost of liv-
ing was 22%, the largest in a five-year period since 1946–1950. But
both stock earnings and stock prices as a whole have declined since
```
1965. There are similar contradictions in both directions in the
record of previous five-year periods.

```
Inflation and Corporate Earnings
```
```
Another and highly important approach to the subject is by a
```
study of the earnings rate on capital shown by American business.

This has fluctuated, of course, with the general rate of economic

activity, but it has shown no general tendency to advance with

wholesale prices or the cost of living. Actually this rate has fallen

rather markedly in the past twenty years in spite of the inflation of

the period. (To some degree the decline was due to the charging of

more liberal depreciation rates. See Table 2-2.) Our extended stud-

ies have led to the conclusion that the investor cannot count on

much above the recent five-year rate earned on the DJIA group—

```
The Investor and Inflation 51
```

```
about 10% on net tangible assets (book value) behind the shares.^2
Since the market value of these issues is well above their book
value—say, 900 market vs. 560 book in mid-1971—the earnings on
current market price work out only at some 6^1 ⁄ 4 %. (This relation-
```
ship is generally expressed in the reverse, or “times earnings,”

manner—e.g., that the DJIA price of 900 equals 18 times the actual

earnings for the 12 months ended June 1971.)

```
Our figures gear in directly with the suggestion in the previous
```
chapter * that the investor may assume an average dividend return

of about 3.5% on the market value of his stocks, plus an apprecia-

tion of, say, 4% annually resulting from reinvested profits. (Note

that each dollar added to book value is here assumed to increase

the market price by about $1.60.)

```
The reader will object that in the end our calculations make no
```
allowance for an increase in common-stock earnings and values to

result from our projected 3% annual inflation. Our justification is

the absence of any sign that the inflation of a comparable amount

in the past has had any _direct_ effect on reported per-share earnings.

```
The cold figures demonstrate that all the large gain in the earnings
of the DJIA unit in the past 20 years was due to a proportionately
large growth of invested capital coming from reinvested profits. If
inflation had operated as a separate favorable factor, its effect
would have been to increase the “value” of previously existing
capital; this in turn should increase the rate of earnings on such old
capital and therefore on the old and new capital combined. But
nothing of the kind actually happened in the past 20 years, during
which the wholesale price level has advanced nearly 40%. (Busi-
ness earnings should be influenced more by wholesale prices than
by “consumer prices.”) The only way that inflation can add to
common stock values is by raising the rate of earnings on cap-
ital investment. On the basis of the past record this has not been
the case.
In the economic cycles of the past, good business was accompa-
nied by a rising price level and poor business by falling prices. It
was generally felt that “a little inflation” was helpful to business
profits. This view is not contradicted by the history of 1950–1970,
```
```
52 The Intelligent Investor
```
```
* See p. 25.
```

```
which reveals a combination of generally continued prosperity and
generally rising prices. But the figures indicate that the effect of all
this on the earning power of common-stock capital (“equity capital”)
has been quite limited; in fact it has not even served to maintain the
rate of earnings on the investment. Clearly there have been impor-
tant offsetting influences which have prevented any increase in the
real profitability of American corporations as a whole. Perhaps the
most important of these have been (1) a rise in wage rates exceed-
ing the gains in productivity, and (2) the need for huge amounts
of new capital, thus holding down the ratio of sales to capital
employed.
Our figures in Table 2-2 indicate that so far from inflation having
benefited our corporations and their shareholders, its effect has
been quite the opposite. The most striking figures in our table are
those for the growth of corporate debt between 1950 and 1969. It is
surprising how little attention has been paid by economists and by
Wall Street to this development. The debt of corporations has
expanded nearly fivefold while their profits before taxes a little
more than doubled. With the great rise in interest rates during this
period, it is evident that the aggregate corporate debt is now an

adverse economic factor of some magnitude and a real problem for
many individual enterprises. (Note that in 1950 net earnings after
interest but before income tax were about 30% of corporate debt,
while in 1969 they were only 13.2% of debt. The 1970 ratio must
have been even less satisfactory.) In sum it appears that a signifi-
cant part of the 11% being earned on corporate equities as a whole
is accomplished by the use of a large amount of new debt costing
4% or less after tax credit. If our corporations had maintained the
debt ratio of 1950, their earnings rate on stock capital would have
fallen still lower, in spite of the inflation.
The stock market has considered that the public-utility enter-
prises have been a chief victim of inflation, being caught between a
great advance in the cost of borrowed money and the difficulty of
raising the rates charged under the regulatory process. But this
may be the place to remark that the very fact that the unit costs of
electricity, gas, and telephone services have advanced so much less
than the general price index puts these companies in a strong
strategic position for the future.^3 They are entitled by law to charge
```
rates sufficient for an adequate return on their invested capital, and

this will probably protect their shareholders in the future as it has

in the inflations of the past.

All of the above brings us back to our conclusion that the
```
investor has no sound basis for expecting more than an average

overall return of, say, 8% on a portfolio of DJIA-type common

stocks purchased at the late 1971 price level. But even if these

expectations should prove to be understated by a substantial

amount, the case would not be made for an all-stock investment

program. If there is one thing guaranteed for the future, it is that

the earnings and average annual market value of a stock portfolio

will _not_ grow at the uniform rate of 4%, or any other figure. In the

```
memorable words of the elder J. P. Morgan, “ They will fluctuate. ”*
This means, first, that the common-stock buyer at today’s prices—

* John Pierpont Morgan was the most powerful financier of the late nine-
teenth and early twentieth centuries. Because of his vast influence, he was
constantly asked what the stock market would do next. Morgan developed a
mercifully short and unfailingly accurate answer: “It will fluctuate.” See Jean
Strouse,Morgan: American Financier(Random House, 1999), p. 11.

or tomorrow’s—will be running a real risk of having unsatisfactory
results therefrom over a period of years. It took 25 years for Gen-
eral Electric (and the DJIA itself) to recover the ground lost in the
1929–1932 debacle. Besides that, if the investor concentrates his
portfolio on common stocks he is very likely to be led astray either
by exhilarating advances or by distressing declines. This is particu-
larly true if his reasoning is geared closely to expectations of fur-
ther inflation. For then, if another bull market comes along, he will
take the big rise not as a danger signal of an inevitable fall, not as a
chance to cash in on his handsome profits, but rather as a vindica-
tion of the inflation hypothesis and as a reason to keep on buying
common stocks no matter how high the market level nor how low
the dividend return. That way lies sorrow.
```
```
Alternatives to Common Stocks as Inflation Hedges
```
```
The standard policy of people all over the world who mistrust
```
their currency has been to buy and hold gold. This has been against

the law for American citizens since 1935—luckily for them. In the

past 35 years the price of gold in the open market has advanced

from $35 per ounce to $48 in early 1972—a rise of only 35%. But

during all this time the holder of gold has received no income

return on his capital, and instead has incurred some annual

expense for storage. Obviously, he would have done much better

with his money at interest in a savings bank, in spite of the rise in

the general price level.

```
The near-complete failure of gold to protect against a loss in the
```
purchasing power of the dollar must cast grave doubt on the abil-

ity of the ordinary investor to protect himself against inflation by

putting his money in “things.”* Quite a few categories of valuable

```
The Investor and Inflation 55
```
```
* The investment philosopher Peter L. Bernstein feels that Graham was
“dead wrong” about precious metals, particularly gold, which (at least in the
years after Graham wrote this chapter) has shown a robust ability to out-
pace inflation. Financial adviser William Bernstein agrees, pointing out that a
tiny allocation to a precious-metals fund (say, 2% of your total assets) is too
small to hurt your overall returns when gold does poorly. But, when gold
does well, its returns are often so spectacular—sometimes exceeding 100%
```

```
objects have had striking advances in market value over the
years—such as diamonds, paintings by masters, first editions of
books, rare stamps and coins, etc. But in many, perhaps most, of
these cases there seems to be an element of the artificial or the pre-
carious or even the unreal about the quoted prices. Somehow it is
hard to think of paying $67,500 for a U.S. silver dollar dated 1804
(but not even minted that year) as an “investment operation.”^4 We
```
acknowledge we are out of our depth in this area. Very few of our

readers will find the swimming safe and easy there.

```
The outright ownership of real estate has long been considered
```
as a sound long-term investment, carrying with it a goodly amount

of protection against inflation. Unfortunately, real-estate values are

also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in

location, price paid, etc.; there are pitfalls in salesmen’s wiles.

Finally, diversification is not practical for the investor of moderate

means, except by various types of participations with others and

with the special hazards that attach to new flotations—not too dif-

ferent from common-stock ownership. This too is not our field. All

we should say to the investor is, “Be sure it’s yours before you go

into it.”

```
Conclusion
```
```
Naturally, we return to the policy recommended in our previous
```
chapter. Just because of the uncertainties of the future the investor

cannot afford to put all his funds into one basket—neither in the

bond basket, despite the unprecedentedly high returns that bonds

have recently offered; nor in the stock basket, despite the prospect

of continuing inflation.

```
The more the investor depends on his portfolio and the income
```
therefrom, the more necessary it is for him to guard against the

```
56 The Intelligent Investor
```
```
in a year—that it can, all by itself, set an otherwise lackluster portfolio glitter-
ing. However, the intelligent investor avoids investing in gold directly, with its
high storage and insurance costs; instead, seek out a well-diversified mutual
fund specializing in the stocks of precious-metal companies and charging
below 1% in annual expenses. Limit your stake to 2% of your total financial
assets (or perhaps 5% if you are over the age of 65).
```

```
unexpected and the disconcerting in this part of his life. It is
axiomatic that the conservative investor should seek to minimize
his risks. We think strongly that the risks involved in buying, say, a
telephone-company bond at yields of nearly 7^1 ⁄ 2 % are much less
than those involved in buying the DJIA at 900 (or any stock list
equivalent thereto). But the possibility of large-scale inflation
```
remains, and the investor must carry some insurance against it.

There is no certainty that a stock component will insure adequately

against such inflation, but it should carry more protection than the

bond component.

```
This is what we said on the subject in our 1965 edition (p. 97),
```
and we would write the same today:

```
It must be evident to the reader that we have no enthusiasm for
common stocks at these levels (892 for the DJIA). For reasons
already given we feel that the defensive investor cannot afford to
be without an appreciable proportion of common stocks in his
portfolio, even if we regard them as the lesser of two evils—the
greater being the risks in an all-bond holding.

Inflation? Who cares about that?
After all, the annual rise in the cost of goods and services averaged
less than 2.2% between 1997 and 2002—and economists believe
that even that rock-bottom rate may be overstated.^1 (Think, for
instance, of how the prices of computers and home electronics have
plummeted—and how the quality of many goods has risen, meaning
that consumers are getting better value for their money.) In recent
years, the true rate of inflation in the United States has probably run
around 1% annually—an increase so infinitesimal that many pundits
have proclaimed that “inflation is dead.”^2
```

Index that measures inflation, maintains a comprehensive and helpful web-
site at [http://www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm.](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm.)
(^2) For a lively discussion of the “inflation is dead” scenario, see [http://www.pbs.](http://www.pbs.)
org/newshour/bb/economy/july-dec97/inflation_12-16.html. In 1996, the
Boskin Commission, a group of economists asked by the government to
investigate whether the official rate of inflation is accurate, estimated that it
has been overstated, often by nearly two percentage points per year. For the
commission’s report, see [http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html.](http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html.) Many
investment experts now feel that deflation, or falling prices, is an even
greater threat than inflation; the best way to hedge against that risk is by
including bonds as a permanent component of your portfolio. (See the com-
mentary on Chapter 4.)


```
THE MONEY ILLUSION
```
```
There’s another reason investors overlook the importance of inflation:
what psychologists call the “money illusion.” If you receive a 2% raise
in a year when inflation runs at 4%, you will almost certainly feel better
than you will if you take a 2% pay cut during a year when inflation is
zero. Yet both changes in your salary leave you in a virtually identical
position—2% worse off after inflation. So long as the nominal(or
absolute) change is positive, we view it as a good thing—even if the
real(or after-inflation) result is negative. And any change in your own
salary is more vivid and specific than the generalized change of prices
in the economy as a whole.^3 Likewise, investors were delighted to earn
```
11% on bank certificates of deposit (CDs) in 1980 and are bitterly

disappointed to be earning only around 2% in 2003—even though

they were losing money after inflation back then but are keeping up

with inflation now. The nominal rate we earn is printed in the bank’s

ads and posted in its window, where a high number makes us feel

good. But inflation eats away at that high number in secret. Instead of

taking out ads, inflation just takes away our wealth. That’s why inflation

is so easy to overlook—and why it’s so important to measure your

investing success not just by what you make, but by how much you

keep after inflation.

```
More basically still, the intelligent investor must always be on guard
```
against whatever is unexpected and underestimated. There are three

good reasons to believe that inflation is not dead:

- As recently as 1973–1982, the United States went through one

```
of the most painful bursts of inflation in our history. As measured
by the Consumer Price Index, prices more than doubled over
that period, rising at an annualized rate of nearly 9%. In 1979
alone, inflation raged at 13.3%, paralyzing the economy in what
became known as “stagflation”—and leading many commentators
to question whether America could compete in the global market-

place.^4 Goods and services priced at $100 in the beginning of
1973 cost $230 by the end of 1982, shriveling the value of a dol-
lar to less than 45 cents. No one who lived through it would scoff
at such destruction of wealth; no one who is prudent can fail to
protect against the risk that it might recur.
```
- Since 1960, 69% of the world’s market-oriented countries have

```
suffered at least one year in which inflation ran at an annualized
rate of 25% or more. On average, those inflationary periods
destroyed 53% of an investor’s purchasing power.^5 We would be
crazy not to hope that America is somehow exempt from such a
disaster. But we would be even crazier to conclude that it can
never happen here.^6
```
- Rising prices allow Uncle Sam to pay off his debts with dollars
    that have been cheapened by inflation. Completely eradicating
    inflation runs against the economic self-interest of any govern-
    ment that regularly borrows money.^7

```
60 Commentary on Chapter 2
```
(^4) That year, President Jimmy Carter gave his famous “malaise” speech, in
which he warned of “a crisis in confidence” that “strikes at the very heart
and soul and spirit of our national will” and “threatens to destroy the social
and the political fabric of America.”
(^5) See Stanley Fischer, Ratna Sahay, and Carlos A. Vegh, “Modern Hyper-
and High Inflations,” National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper
8930, at [http://www.nber.org/papers/w8930.](http://www.nber.org/papers/w8930.)
(^6) In fact, the United States has had two periods of hyperinflation. During the
American Revolution, prices roughly tripled every year from 1777 through
1779, with a pound of butter costing $12 and a barrel of flour fetching
nearly $1,600 in Revolutionary Massachusetts. During the Civil War, infla-
tion raged at annual rates of 29% (in the North) and nearly 200% (in the
Confederacy). As recently as 1946, inflation hit 18.1% in the United States.
(^7) I am indebted to Laurence Siegel of the Ford Foundation for this cynical,
but accurate, insight. Conversely, in a time of deflation (or steadily falling
prices) it’s more advantageous to be a lender than a borrower—which is why
most investors should keep at least a small portion of their assets in bonds,
as a form of insurance against deflating prices.


```
HALF A HEDGE
```
```
What, then, can the intelligent investor do to guard against inflation?
The standard answer is “buy stocks”—but, as common answers so
often are, it is not entirely true.
Figure 2-1 shows, for each year from 1926 through 2002, the rela-
tionship between inflation and stock prices.
As you can see, in years when the prices of consumer goods and
services fell, as on the left side of the graph, stock returns were terri-
ble—with the market losing up to 43% of its value.^8 When inflation shot
```
above 6%, as in the years on the right end of the graph, stocks also

stank. The stock market lost money in eight of the 14 years in which

inflation exceeded 6%; the average return for those 14 years was a

measly 2.6%.

```
While mild inflation allows companies to pass the increased costs
```
of their own raw materials on to customers, high inflation wreaks

havoc—forcing customers to slash their purchases and depressing

activity throughout the economy.

```
The historical evidence is clear: Since the advent of accurate
stock-market data in 1926, there have been 64 five-year periods
(i.e., 1926–1930, 1927–1931, 1928–1932, and so on through
1998–2002). In 50 of those 64 five-year periods (or 78% of the time),
stocks outpaced inflation.^9 That’s impressive, but imperfect; it means
that stocks failed to keep up with inflation about one-fifth of the time.
```
```
Commentary on Chapter 2 61
```
(^8) When inflation is negative, it is technically termed “deflation.” Regularly
falling prices may at first sound appealing, until you think of the Japanese
example. Prices have been deflating in Japan since 1989, with real estate
and the stock market dropping in value year after year—a relentless water
torture for the world’s second-largest economy.

(Ibbotson Associates, Chicago, 2003), Table 2-8. The same pattern is evi-

tion was especially high in the twentieth century, “inflation appears to have
had a negative impact on both stock and bond markets,” note Elroy Dimson,
Paul Marsh, and Mike Staunton in Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of
Global Investment Returns(Princeton University Press, 2002), p. 53.

TWO ACRONYMS TO THE RESCUE
```
```
Fortunately, you can bolster your defenses against inflation by branch-
ing out beyond stocks. Since Graham last wrote, two inflation-fighters
have become widely available to investors:
REITs. Real Estate Investment Trusts, or REITs (pronounced
```
“reets”), are companies that own and collect rent from commercial

and residential properties.^10 Bundled into real-estate mutual funds,

REITs do a decent job of combating inflation. The best choice is Van-

guard REIT Index Fund; other relatively low-cost choices include

Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, Columbia Real Estate Equity Fund,

and Fidelity Real Estate Investment Fund.^11 While a REIT fund is

unlikely to be a foolproof inflation-fighter, in the long run it should give

you some defense against the erosion of purchasing power without

hampering your overall returns.

```
TIPS.Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are U.S.
government bonds, first issued in 1997, that automatically go up in
value when inflation rises. Because the full faith and credit of the
United States stands behind them, all Treasury bonds are safe from
the risk of default (or nonpayment of interest). But TIPS also guaran-
tee that the value of your investment won’t be eroded by inflation. In
one easy package, you insure yourself against financial loss and the
loss of purchasing power.^12
There is one catch, however. When the value of your TIPS bond
```
rises as inflation heats up, the Internal Revenue Service regards that

increase in value as taxable income—even though it is purely a paper

stake in real-estate ownership.

gain (unless you sold the bond at its newly higher price). Why does

this make sense to the IRS? The intelligent investor will remember the

wise words of financial analyst Mark Schweber: “The one question

never to ask a bureaucrat is ‘Why?’ ” Because of this exasperating tax

complication, TIPS are best suited for a tax-deferred retirement

account like an IRA, Keogh, or 401(k), where they will not jack up your

taxable income.

```
You can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. government at http://www.
```
publicdebt.treas.gov/of/ofinflin.htm, or in a low-cost mutual fund like

Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities or Fidelity Inflation-Protected

Bond Fund.^13 Either directly or through a fund, TIPS are the ideal sub-

stitute for the proportion of your retirement funds you would otherwise

keep in cash. Do not trade them: TIPS can be volatile in the short run,

so they work best as a permanent, lifelong holding. For most investors,

allocating at least 10% of your retirement assets to TIPS is an intelli-

gent way to keep a portion of your money absolutely safe—and entirely

beyond the reach of the long, invisible claws of inflation.

CHAPTER 3

_A Century of Stock-Market History:_

_The Level of Stock Prices in Early 1972_

_T_ he investor’s portfolio of common stocks will represent a small

cross-section of that immense and formidable institution known as

the stock market. Prudence suggests that he have an adequate idea

of stock-market history, in terms particularly of the major fluctua-

tions in its price level and of the varying relationships between

stock prices as a whole and their earnings and dividends. With this

background he may be in a position to form some worthwhile

judgment of the attractiveness or dangers of the level of the market

as it presents itself at different times. By a coincidence, useful sta-

tistical data on prices, earnings, and dividends go back just 100

years, to 1871. (The material is not nearly as full or dependable in

the first half-period as in the second, but it will serve.) In this chap-

ter we shall present the figures, in highly condensed form, with

two objects in view. The first is to show the general manner in

which stocks have made their underlying advance through the

many cycles of the past century. The second is to view the picture

in terms of successive ten-year averages, not only of stock prices

but of earnings and dividends as well, to bring out the varying

relationship between the three important factors. With this wealth

of material as a background we shall pass to a consideration of the

level of stock prices at the beginning of 1972.

patterns, each covering about a third of the 70 years. The first runs

from 1900 to 1924, and shows for the most part a series of rather

similar market cycles lasting from three to five years. The annual

advance in this period averaged just about 3%. We move on to the

“New Era” bull market, culminating in 1929, with its terrible after-

math of collapse, followed by quite irregular fluctuations until

our second period found the public with no enthusiasm at all for
common stocks. By the rule of opposites the time was ripe for the
beginning of the greatest bull market in our history, presented in
the last third of our chart. This phenomenon may have reached its
culmination in December 1968 at 118 for Standard & Poor’s 425
industrials (and 108 for its 500-stock composite). As Table 3-1
shows, there were fairly important setbacks between 1949 and 1968
(especially in 1956–57 and 1961–62), but the recoveries therefrom
were so rapid that they had to be denominated (in the long-
accepted semantics) as recessions in a single bull market, rather
than as separate market cycles. Between the low level of 162 for
“the Dow” in mid-1949 and the high of 995 in early 1966, the
advance had been more than sixfold in 17 years—which is at the
average compounded rate of 11% per year, not counting dividends
of, say, 3^1 ⁄ 2 % per annum. (The advance for the Standard & Poor’s

composite index was somewhat greater than that of the DJIA—

actually from 14 to 96.)

on Wall Street with such fine achievements, and a quite illogical and
dangerous conviction that equally marvelous results could be
expected for common stocks in the future. Few people seem to have
been bothered by the thought that the very extent of the rise might
indicate that it had been overdone. The subsequent decline from the
1968 high to the 1970 low was 36% for the Standard & Poor’s com-
posite (and 37% for the DJIA), the largest since the 44% suffered in
1939–1942, which had reflected the perils and uncertainties after
Pearl Harbor. In the dramatic manner so characteristic of Wall
Street, the low level of May 1970 was followed by a massive and
speedy recovery of both averages, and the establishment of a new
all-time high for the Standard & Poor’s industrials in early 1972.
The annual rate of price advance between 1949 and 1970 works out
at about 9% for the S & P composite (or the industrial index), using
the average figures for both years. That rate of climb was, of course,
much greater than for any similar period before 1950. (But in the last
decade the rate of advance was much lower—5^1 ⁄ 4 % for the S & P
```
composite index and only the once familiar 3% for the DJIA.)

```
The record of price movements should be supplemented by cor-
```
responding figures for earnings and dividends, in order to provide

an overall view of what has happened to our share economy over

the ten decades. We present a conspectus of this kind in our Table

3-2 (p. 71). It is a good deal to expect from the reader that he study

all these figures with care, but for some we hope they will be inter-

esting and instructive.

Let us comment on them as follows: The full decade figures

ture of persistent growth. Only two of the nine decades after the

first show a decrease in earnings and average prices (in 1891–1900

and 1931–1940), and no decade after 1900 shows a decrease in aver-

age dividends. But the rates of growth in all three categories are

quite variable. In general the performance since World War II has

been superior to that of earlier decades, but the advance in the

1960s was less pronounced than that of the 1950s. Today’s investor

dends and prices he may expect in the next ten years, but it does

supply all the encouragement he needs for a consistent policy of

common-stock investment.

```
However, a point should be made here that is not disclosed in
```
our table. The year 1970 was marked by a definite deterioration in

the overall earnings posture of our corporations. The rate of profit

on invested capital fell to the lowest percentage since the World

War years. Equally striking is the fact that a considerable number

of companies reported net losses for the year; many became “finan-

cially troubled,” and for the first time in three decades there were

quite a few important bankruptcy proceedings. These facts as

much as any others have prompted the statement made above*

that the great boom era may have come to an end in 1969–1970.

```
A striking feature of Table 3-2 is the change in the price/earn-
```
ings ratios since World War II.† In June 1949 the S & P composite

index sold at only 6.3 times the applicable earnings of the past 12

months; in March 1961 the ratio was 22.9 times. Similarly, the divi-

dend yield on the S & P index had fallen from over 7% in 1949 to

only 3.0% in 1961, a contrast heightened by the fact that interest

rates on high-grade bonds had meanwhile risen from 2.60% to

4.50%. This is certainly the most remarkable turnabout in the

public’s attitude in all stock-market history.

```
To people of long experience and innate caution the passage
```
from one extreme to another carried a strong warning of trou-

ble ahead. They could not help thinking apprehensively of the

1926–1929 bull market and its tragic aftermath. But these fears have

not been confirmed by the event. True, the closing price of the DJIA

† The “price/earnings ratio” of a stock, or of a market average like the S & P

500-stock index, is a simple tool for taking the market’s temperature. If, for

instance, a company earned $1 per share of net income over the past year,

and its stock is selling at $8.93 per share, its price/earnings ratio would be

8.93; if, however, the stock is selling at $69.70, then the price/earnings ratio

would be 69.7. In general, a price/earnings ratio (or “P/E” ratio) below 10 is

considered low, between 10 and 20 is considered moderate, and greater

than 20 is considered expensive. (For more on P/E ratios, see p. 168.)

```
The Stock-Market Level in Early 1972
```
```
With a century-long conspectus of stock, prices, earnings, and
dividends before our eyes, let us try to draw some conclusions
about the level of 900 for the DJIA and 100 for the S & P composite
index in January 1972.
In each of our former editions we have discussed the level of the
stock market at the time of writing, and endeavored to answer the
question whether it was too high for conservative purchase. The
reader may find it informing to review the conclusions we reached
on these earlier occasions. This is not entirely an exercise in self-
punishment. It will supply a sort of connecting tissue that links the
various stages of the stock market in the past twenty years and also
a taken-from-life picture of the difficulties facing anyone who tries
to reach an informed and critical judgment of current market lev-
els. Let us, first, reproduce the summary of the 1948, 1953, and 1959
analyses that we gave in the 1965 edition:
```
```
In 1948 we applied conservative standards to the Dow Jones
level of 180, and found no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that
“it was not too high in relation to underlying values.” When we
approached this problem in 1953 the average market level for that
year had reached 275, a gain of over 50% in five years. We asked
ourselves the same question—namely, “whether in our opinion the
level of 275 for the Dow Jones Industrials was or was not too high
for sound investment.” In the light of the subsequent spectacular
advance, it may seem strange to have to report that it was by no
means easy for us to reach a definitive conclusion as to the attrac-
tiveness of the 1953 level. We did say, positively enough, that
“from the standpoint of value indications—our chief investment
guide—the conclusion about 1953 stock prices must be favorable.”
But we were concerned about the fact that in 1953, the averages
had advanced for a longer period than in most bull markets of the
```
```
72 The Intelligent Investor
```

past, and that its absolute level was historically high. Setting these

factors against our favorable value judgment, we advised a cau-

tious or compromise policy. As it turned out, this was not a partic-

ularly brilliant counsel. A good prophet would have foreseen that

the market level was due to advance an additional 100% in the

next five years. Perhaps we should add in self-defense that few if

any of those whose business was stock-market forecasting—as

ours was not—had any better inkling than we did of what lay

ahead.

```
At the beginning of 1959 we found the DJIA at an all-time high
```
of 584. Our lengthy analysis made from all points of view may be

summarized in the following (from page 59 of the 1959 edition):

“In sum, we feel compelled to express the conclusion that the pres-

ent level of stock prices is a dangerous one. It may well be perilous

because prices are already far too high. But even if this is not the

case the market’s momentum is such as inevitably to carry it to

unjustifiable heights. Frankly, we cannot imagine a market of the

future in which there will never be any serious losses, and in

which, every tyro will be guaranteed a large profit on his stock

purchases.”

```
The caution we expressed in 1959 was somewhat better justi-
```
fied by the sequel than was our corresponding attitude in 1954. Yet

it was far from fully vindicated. The DJIA advanced to 685 in 1961;

then fell a little below our 584 level (to 566) later in the year;

advanced again to 735 in late 1961; and then declined in near panic

to 536 in May 1962, showing a loss of 27% within the brief period

of six months. At the same time there was a far more serious

shrinkage in the most popular “growth stocks”—as evidenced by

the striking fall of the indisputable leader, International Business

Machines, from a high of 607 in December 1961 to a low of 300 in

June 1962.

```
This period saw a complete debacle in a host of newly launched
```
common stocks of small enterprises—the so-called hot issues—

which had been offered to the public at ridiculously high prices

and then had been further pushed up by needless speculation to

levels little short of insane. Many of these lost 90% and more of the

quotations in just a few months.

```
The collapse in the first half of 1962 was disconcerting, if not
```
disastrous, to many self-acknowledged speculators and perhaps

```
A Century of Stock-Market History 73
```

```
to many more imprudent people who called themselves “in-
vestors.” But the turnabout that came later that year was equally
unsuspected by the financial community. The stock-market aver-
ages resumed their upward course, producing the following
sequence:
```
```
Standard & Poor’s
DJIA 500-Stock Composite
```
December 1961 735 72.64

June 1962 536 52.32

```
November 1964 892 86.28
```
```
The recovery and new ascent of common-stock prices was
indeed remarkable and created a corresponding revision of Wall
Street sentiment. At the low level of June 1962 predictions had
appeared predominantly bearish, and after the partial recovery to
the end of that year they were mixed, leaning to the skeptical side.
But at the outset of 1964 the natural optimism of brokerage firms
was again manifest; nearly all the forecasts were on the bullish
side, and they so continued through the 1964 advance.
```
```
We then approached the task of appraising the November 1964
```
levels of the stock market (892 for the DJIA). After discussing

it learnedly from numerous angles we reached three main con-

clusions. The first was that “old standards (of valuation) appear

inapplicable; new standards have not yet been tested by time.”

The second was that the investor “must base his policy on the

existence of major uncertainties. The possibilities compass the

extremes, on the one hand, of a protracted and further advance in

the market’s level—say by 50%, or to 1350 for the DJIA; or, on the

other hand, of a largely unheralded collapse of the same magni-

tude, bringing the average in the neighborhood of, say, 450"

(p. 63). The third was expressed in much more definite terms. We

said: “Speaking bluntly, if the 1964 price level is not too high how

could we say that _any_ price level is too high?” And the chapter

```
closed as follows:
```
```
74 The Intelligent Investor
```

```
WHAT COURSE TO FOLLOW
```
```
Investors should not conclude that the 1964 market level is dan-
gerous merely because they read it in this book. They must weigh
our reasoning against the contrary reasoning they will hear from
most competent and experienced people on Wall Street. In the end
each one must make his own decision and accept responsibility
therefor. We suggest, however, that if the investor is in doubt as to
which course to pursue he should choose the path of caution. The
principles of investment, as set forth herein, would call for the fol-
lowing policy under 1964 conditions, in order of urgency:
```
1. No borrowing to buy or hold securities.
2. No increase in the proportion of funds held in common stocks.
3. A reduction in common-stock holdings where needed to bring
    it down to a maximum of 50 per cent of the total portfolio. The
    capital-gains tax must be paid with as good grace as possible,
    and the proceeds invested in first-quality bonds or held as a
    savings deposit.

```
Investors who for some time have been following a bona fide
dollar-cost averaging plan can in logic elect either to continue their
periodic purchases unchanged or to suspend them until they feel
the market level is no longer dangerous. We should advise rather
strongly against the initiation of a new dollar-averaging plan at the
late 1964 levels, since many investors would not have the stamina
to pursue such a scheme if the results soon after initiation should
appear highly unfavorable.
```
```
This time we can say that our caution was vindicated. The DJIA
```
advanced about 11% further, to 995, but then fell irregularly to a

low of 632 in 1970, and finished that year at 839. The same kind of

debacle took place in the price of “hot issues”—i.e., with declines

running as much as 90%—as had happened in the 1961–62 setback.

And, as pointed out in the Introduction, the whole financial picture

appeared to have changed in the direction of less enthusiasm and

greater doubts. A single fact may summarize the story: The DJIA

closed 1970 at a level lower than six years before—the first time

such a thing had happened since 1944.

```
A Century of Stock-Market History 75
```

```
Such were our efforts to evaluate former stock-market levels. Is
```
there anything we and our readers can learn from them? We con-

sidered the market level favorable for investment in 1948 and 1953

(but too cautiously in the latter year), “dangerous” in 1959 (at 584

for DJIA), and “too high” (at 892) in 1964. All of these judgments

could be defended even today by adroit arguments. But it is doubt-

ful if they have been as useful as our more pedestrian counsels—in

favor of a consistent and controlled common-stock policy on the

one hand, and discouraging endeavors to “beat the market” or to

“pick the winners” on the other.

```
Nonetheless we think our readers may derive some benefit from
```
a renewed consideration of the level of the stock market—this time

as of late 1971—even if what we have to say will prove more inter-

esting than practically useful, or more indicative than conclusive.

There is a fine passage near the beginning of Aristotle’s _Ethics_ that

goes: “It is the mark of an educated mind to expect that amount of

exactness which the nature of the particular subject admits. It is

equally unreasonable to accept merely probable conclusions from a

mathematician and to demand strict demonstration from an ora-

tor.” The work of a financial analyst falls somewhere in the middle

between that of a mathematician and of an orator.

```
At various times in 1971 the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood
```
at the 892 level of November 1964 that we considered in our previ-

ous edition. But in the present statistical study we have decided to

use the price level and the related data for the Standard & Poor’s

composite index (or S & P 500), because it is more comprehensive

and representative of the general market than the 30-stock DJIA.

We shall concentrate on a comparison of this material near the four

dates of our former editions—namely the year-ends of 1948, 1953,

1958 and 1963—plus 1968; for the current price level we shall take

the convenient figure of 100, which was registered at various times

in 1971 and in early 1972. The salient data are set forth in Table 3-3.

For our earnings figures we present both the last year’s showing

and the average of three calendar years; for 1971 dividends we use

the last twelve months’ figures; and for 1971 bond interest and

wholesale prices those of August 1971.

```
The 3-year price/earnings ratio for the market was lower in
```
October 1971 than at year-end 1963 and 1968. It was about the same

as in 1958, but much higher than in the early years of the long bull

market. This important indicator, taken by itself, could not be con-

strued to indicate that the market was especially high in January

1972. But when the interest yield on high-grade bonds is brought

into the picture, the implications become much less favorable. The

reader will note from our table that the ratio of stock returns (earn-

ings/price) to bond returns has grown worse during the entire

period, so that the January 1972 figure was less favorable to stocks,

by this criterion, than in any of the previous years examined. When

dividend yields are compared with bond yields we find that the

relationship was completely reversed between 1948 and 1972. In

the early year stocks yielded twice as much as bonds; now bonds

yield twice as much, and more, than stocks.

```
Our final judgment is that the adverse change in the bond-
```
yield/stock-yield ratio fully offsets the better price/earnings ratio

for late 1971, based on the 3-year earnings figures. Hence our view

of the early 1972 market level would tend to be the same as it was

some 7 years ago—i.e., that it is an unattractive one from the stand-

point of conservative investment. (This would apply to most of the

1971 price range of the DJIA: between, say, 800 and 950.)

```
In terms of historical market swings the 1971 picture would still
```
appear to be one of irregular recovery from the bad setback suf-

fered in 1969–1970. In the past such recoveries have ushered in a

new stage of the recurrent and persistent bull market that began in

1949. (This was the expectation of Wall Street generally during

1971.) After the terrible experience suffered by the public buyers of

low-grade common-stock offerings in the 1968–1970 cycle, it is too

early (in 1971) for another twirl of the new-issue merry-go-round.

Hence that dependable sign of imminent danger in the market is

lacking now, as it was at the 892 level of the DJIA in November

1964, considered in our previous edition. Technically, then, the out-

look would appear to favor another substantial rise far beyond the

900 DJIA level before the next serious setback or collapse. But we

cannot quite leave the matter there, as perhaps we should. To us,

the early-1971-market’s disregard of the harrowing experiences of

less than a year before is a disquieting sign. Can such heedlessness

go unpunished? We think the investor must be prepared for diffi-

cult times ahead—perhaps in the form of a fairly quick replay of

the the 1969–1970 decline, or perhaps in the form of another bull-

market fling, to be followed by a more catastrophic collapse.^3

**BULL-MARKET BALONEY**

In this chapter, Graham shows how prophetic he can be. He looks

two years ahead, foreseeing the “catastrophic” bear market of

1973–1974, in which U.S. stocks lost 37% of their value.^1 He also

looks more than two decades into the future, eviscerating the logic of

market gurus and best-selling books that were not even on the horizon

in his lifetime.

```
The heart of Graham’s argument is that the intelligent investor must
```
never forecast the future exclusively by extrapolating the past. Unfortu-

nately, that’s exactly the mistake that one pundit after another made in

the 1990s. A stream of bullish books followed Wharton finance pro-

fessor Jeremy Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run(1994)—culminating,

in a wild crescendo, with James Glassman and Kevin Hassett’s Dow

36,000, David Elias’ Dow 40,000, and Charles Kadlec’s Dow

100,000(all published in 1999). Forecasters argued that stocks had

returned an annual average of 7% after inflation ever since 1802.

Therefore, they concluded, that’s what investors should expect in the

future.

```
Some bulls went further. Since stocks had “always” beaten bonds
```
over any period of at least 30 years, stocks must be less risky than

bonds or even cash in the bank. And if you can eliminate all the risk of

owning stocks simply by hanging on to them long enough, then why

quibble over how much you pay for them in the first place? (To find out
why, see the sidebar on p. 82.)
In 1999 and early 2000, bull-market baloney was everywhere:
```
- On December 7, 1999, Kevin Landis, portfolio manager of the
    Firsthand mutual funds, appeared on CNN’s Moneylinetelecast.
    Asked if wireless telecommunication stocks were overvalued—
    with many trading at infinite multiples of their earnings—Landis
    had a ready answer. “It’s not a mania,” he shot back. “Look at the
    outright growth, the absolute value of the growth. It’s big.”
- On January 18, 2000, Robert Froelich, chief investment strategist
    at the Kemper Funds, declared in the Wall Street Journal:“It’s a
new world order. We see people discard all the right companies
with all the right people with the right vision because their stock
price is too high—that’s the worst mistake an investor can make.”
- In the April 10, 2000, issue of BusinessWeek,Jeffrey M. Apple-

```
gate, then the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers,
asked rhetorically: “Is the stock market riskier today than two
years ago simply because prices are higher? The answer is no.”
```
```
But the answer is yes.It always has been. It always will be.
And when Graham asked, “Can such heedlessness go unpun-
```
ished?” he knew that the eternal answer to that question is no.Like an

enraged Greek god, the stock market crushed everyone who had

come to believe that the high returns of the late 1990s were some

kind of divine right. Just look at how those forecasts by Landis,

Froelich, and Applegate held up:

- From 2000 through 2002, the most stable of Landis’s pet wire-

```
less stocks, Nokia, lost “only” 67%—while the worst, Winstar
Communications, lost 99.9%.
```
- Froelich’s favorite stocks—Cisco Systems and Motorola—fell more

```
than 70% by late 2002. Investors lost over $400 billion on Cisco
alone—more than the annual economic output of Hong Kong,
Israel, Kuwait, and Singapore combined.
```
- In April 2000, when Applegate asked his rhetorical question, the

```
Dow Jones Industrials stood at 11,187; the NASDAQ Composite
Index was at 4446. By the end of 2002, the Dow was hobbling
around the 8,300 level, while NASDAQ had withered to roughly
1300—eradicating all its gains over the previous six years.

```
SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST
```
There was a fatal flaw in the argument that stocks have “always”

beaten bonds in the long run: Reliable figures before 1871 do

not exist. The indexes used to represent the U.S. stock market’s

earliest returns contain as few as seven (yes, 7!) stocks.^1 By

1800, however, there were some 300 companies in America

(many in the Jeffersonian equivalents of the Internet: wooden

turnpikes and canals). Most went bankrupt, and their investors

lost their knickers.

```
But the stock indexes ignore all the companies that went
```
bust in those early years, a problem technically known as “sur-

vivorship bias.” Thus these indexes wildly overstate the results

earned by real-life investors—who lacked the 20/20 hindsight

necessary to know exactly which seven stocks to buy. A lonely

handful of companies, including Bank of New York and J. P. Mor-

gan Chase, have prospered continuously since the 1790s. But

for every such miraculous survivor, there were thousands of

financial disasters like the Dismal Swamp Canal Co., the Penn-

sylvania Cultivation of Vines Co., and the Snickers’s Gap Turn-

pike Co.—all omitted from the “historical” stock indexes.

```
Jeremy Siegel’s data show that, after inflation, from 1802
```
through 1870 stocks gained 7.0% per year, bonds 4.8%, and

cash 5.1%. But Elroy Dimson and his colleagues at London

Business School estimate that the pre-1871 stock returns are

overstated by at least two percentage points per year.^2 In the

real world, then, stocks did no better than cash and bonds—and

perhaps a bit worse. Anyone who claims that the long-term

record “proves” that stocks are guaranteed to outperform

bonds or cash is an ignoramus.

(^1) By the 1840s, these indexes had widened to include a maximum of seven finan-
cial stocks and 27 railroad stocks—still an absurdly unrepresentative sample of the
rambunctious young American stock market.
(^2) See Jason Zweig, “New Cause for Caution on Stocks,” Time,May 6, 2002,
p. 71. As Graham hints on p. 65, even the stock indexes between 1871 and
the 1920s suffer from survivorship bias, thanks to the hundreds of automobile,
aviation, and radio companies that went bust without a trace. These returns,
too, are probably overstated by one to two percentage points.


```
THE HIGHER THEY GO,
THE HARDER THEY FALL
```
```
As the enduring antidote to this kind of bull-market baloney, Graham
urges the intelligent investor to ask some simple, skeptical questions.
Why should the future returns of stocks always be the same as their
past returns? When every investor comes to believe that stocks are
guaranteed to make money in the long run, won’t the market end up
being wildly overpriced? And once that happens, how can future
returns possibly be high?
Graham’s answers, as always, are rooted in logic and common
sense. The value of any investment is, and always must be, a function
of the price you pay for it. By the late 1990s, inflation was withering
away, corporate profits appeared to be booming, and most of the
world was at peace. But that did not mean—nor could it ever mean—
that stocks were worth buying at any price.Since the profits that com-
```
panies can earn are finite, the price that investors should be willing to

pay for stocks must also be finite.

```
Think of it this way: Michael Jordan may well have been the great-
```
est basketball player of all time, and he pulled fans into Chicago Sta-

dium like a giant electromagnet. The Chicago Bulls got a bargain by

paying Jordan up to $34 million a year to bounce a big leather ball

around a wooden floor. But that does not mean the Bulls would have

been justified paying him $340 million, or $3.4 billion, or $34 billion,

per season.

**THE LIMITS OF OPTIMISM**

Focusing on the market’s recent returns when they have been rosy,

warns Graham, will lead to “a quite illogical and dangerous conclusion

that equally marvelous results could be expected for common stocks

in the future.” From 1995 through 1999, as the market rose by at least

20% each year—a surge unprecedented in American history—stock

buyers became ever more optimistic:

- In mid-1998, investors surveyed by the Gallup Organization for

```
the PaineWebber brokerage firm expected their portfolios to earn
an average of roughly 13% over the year to come. By early 2000,
their average expected return had jumped to more than 18%.
```
```
Commentary on Chapter 3 83
```

- “Sophisticated professionals” were just as bullish, jacking up their
    own assumptions of future returns. In 2001, for instance, SBC
    Communications raised the projected return on its pension plan
    from 8.5% to 9.5%. By 2002, the average assumed rate of return
    on the pension plans of companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-
    stock index had swollen to a record-high 9.2%.

```
A quick follow-up shows the awful aftermath of excess enthusiasm:
```
- Gallup found in 2001 and 2002 that the average expectation of
    one-year returns on stocks had slumped to 7%—even though
    investors could now buy at prices nearly 50% lower than in
    2000.^2
- Those gung-ho assumptions about the returns on their pension
    plans will cost the companies in the S & P 500 a bare minimum of
    $32 billion between 2002 and 2004, according to recent Wall
    Street estimates.

```
Even though investors all know they’re supposed to buy low and
sell high, in practice they often end up getting it backwards. Graham’s
warning in this chapter is simple: “By the rule of opposites,” the more
enthusiastic investors become about the stock market in the long run,
the more certain they are to be proved wrong in the short run. On
March 24, 2000, the total value of the U.S. stock market peaked at
$14.75 trillion. By October 9, 2002, just 30 months later, the total
U.S. stock market was worth $7.34 trillion, or 50.2% less—a loss of
$7.41 trillion. Meanwhile, many market pundits turned sourly bear-
ish, predicting flat or even negative market returns for years—even
decades—to come.
At this point, Graham would ask one simple question: Considering
how calamitously wrong the “experts” were the last time they agreed
on something, why on earth should the intelligent investor believe
them now?
```
```
84 Commentary on Chapter 3
```
(^2) Those cheaper stock prices do not mean, of course, that investors’ expec-
tation of a 7% stock return will be realized.


```
WHAT’S NEXT?
```
```
Instead, let’s tune out the noise and think about future returns as Gra-
ham might. The stock market’s performance depends on three factors:
```
- real growth (the rise of companies’ earnings and dividends)
- inflationary growth (the general rise of prices throughout the
    economy)
- speculative growth—or decline (any increase or decrease in the
    investing public’s appetite for stocks)

```
In the long run, the yearly growth in corporate earnings per share
has averaged 1.5% to 2% (not counting inflation).^3 As of early 2003,
inflation was running around 2.4% annually; the dividend yield on
stocks was 1.9%. So,
```
```
1.5% to 2%
+ 2.4%
+ 1.9%
= 5.8% to 6.3%
```
```
In the long run, that means you can reasonably expect stocks to
```
average roughly a 6% return (or 4% after inflation). If the investing

public gets greedy again and sends stocks back into orbit, then that

speculative fever will temporarily drive returns higher. If, instead,

investors are full of fear, as they were in the 1930s and 1970s, the

returns on stocks will go temporarily lower. (That’s where we are in

2003.)

```
Robert Shiller, a finance professor at Yale University, says Graham
```
inspired his valuation approach: Shiller compares the current price of

the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index against average corporate

profits over the past 10 years (after inflation). By scanning the histori-

cal record, Shiller has shown that when his ratio goes well above 20,

the market usually delivers poor returns afterward; when it drops well

Notes: Price/earnings ratio is Shiller calculation (10-year average real earnings of

S & P 500-stock index divided by December 31 index value). Total return is nominal

annual average.

below 10, stocks typically produce handsome gains down the road. In

early 2003, by Shiller’s math, stocks were priced at about 22.8 times

the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the past decade—still in the

danger zone, but way down from their demented level of 44.2 times

earnings in December 1999.

```
How has the market done in the past when it was priced around
```
today’s levels? Figure 3-1 shows the previous periods when stocks

were at similar highs, and how they fared over the 10-year stretches

that followed:


```
So, from valuation levels similar to those of early 2003, the stock
```
market has sometimes done very well in the ensuing 10 years, some-

times poorly, and muddled along the rest of the time. I think Graham,

ever the conservative, would split the difference between the lowest

and highest past returns and project that over the next decade stocks

will earn roughly 6% annually, or 4% after inflation. (Interestingly, that

projection matches the estimate we got earlier when we added

together real growth, inflationary growth, and speculative growth.)

Compared to the 1990s, 6% is chicken feed. But it’s a whisker better

than the gains that bonds are likely to produce—and reason enough for

most investors to hang on to stocks as part of a diversified portfolio.

```
But there is a second lesson in Graham’s approach. The only thing
```
you can be confident of while forecasting future stock returns is that

you will probably turn out to be wrong. The only indisputable truth that

the past teaches us is that the future will always surprise us—always!

And the corollary to that law of financial history is that the markets will

most brutally surprise the very people who are most certain that their

views about the future are right. Staying humble about your forecast-

ing powers, as Graham did, will keep you from risking too much on a

view of the future that may well turn out to be wrong.

```
So, by all means, you should lower your expectations—but take care
```
not to depress your spirit. For the intelligent investor, hope always

springs eternal, because it should.In the financial markets, the worse

```
the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be. A cynic once told
G. K. Chesterton, the British novelist and essayist, “Blessed is he who
expecteth nothing, for he shall not be disappointed.” Chesterton’s
rejoinder? “Blessed is he who expecteth nothing, for he shall enjoy
everything.”
