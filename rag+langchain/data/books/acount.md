# Preface	

## How	to	use	this	book

This	book	is	the	result	of	an	evolving	idea:	everyday	investors	should	not	need	a
master’s	in	finance	to	understand	the	fundamentals	of	Warren	Buffett’s	investing
approach.	 In	 2012,	 we	 wrote	 a	 book	 titled	 _Warren	 Buffett’s	 Three	 Favorite
Books_ .	The	book	was	written	for	amateur	investors	so	they	could	understand	the
very	basic	and	fundamental	ideas	around	Warren	Buffett’s	investing	approach.

This	 book,	 however,	 takes	 investing	 to	 the	 next	 step—it	 teaches	 essential
accounting	 terminology	 and	 techniques	 that	 serious	 stock	 investors	 need	 to
know.	The	first	four	chapters	of	this	book	teach	you	how	to	think	about	the	stock
market,	 how	 to	 select	 and	 value	 stocks.	 Only	 limited	 accounting	 skills	 or
knowledge	will	be	required	for	this.	If	you	want	to	dig	further	into	corporate
accounting,	the	last	four	chapters	are	where	you	will	have	a	chance	to	get	your
hands	 dirty.	 This	 is	 where	 we	 will	 discuss	 the	 individual	 lines	 of	 accounting
found	on	the	three	financial	statements.	Since	this	book’s	principles	are	based	on
the	ideas	of	a	few	brilliant	people,	let’s	start	with	a	brief	introduction:


#### Warren	Buffett	(1930	-	)

Starting	out	from	nothing,	Warren	Buffett	is	now	perceived	as	the	greatest	stock


market	investor	of	all	time.	His	current	net	worth	is	in	excess	of	$60	billion.	His
fortune	has	been	built	on	a	sound	and	consistent	investment	approach—which
we	 will	 outline	 throughout	 this	 book.	 He	 is	 the	 CEO	 of	 a	 company	 called
Berkshire	Hathaway.	Berkshire	is	an	American	conglomerate	holding	company,
of	which	he	is	the	largest	shareholder.	More	than	99%	of	his	net	worth	has	been
pledged	to	philanthropy.


#### Benjamin	Graham	(1894-1974)

By	 many,	 Graham	 is	 considered	 the	 founder	 of	 value	 investing.	 Benjamin


Graham	was	Warren	Buffett’s	professor	at	Columbia	University,	and	was	also
Buffett’s	employer,	mentor,	and	lifelong	friend.	Benjamin	Graham	is	the	author
of	 the	 _The	 Intelligent	 Investor_ and	 _Security	 Analysis_ ,	 undoubtedly	 the	 most
important	value	investing	literature	ever	written.	Warren	Buffett	has,	on	several
occasions,	credited	these	books	as	shaping	his	philosophy	as	an	investor.


#### Charles	Munger	(1924	-	)

Vice-Chairman	at	Berkshire	Hathaway	and	mainly	known	for	being	a	business


partner	 with	 Warren	 Buffett.	 Less	 known	 than	 Buffett,	 Charlie	 Munger	 is
equally	 respected	 by	 value	 investors	 for	 his	 strong	 character	 and	 sound
investment	 approach.	 Munger’s	 investment	 talent	 has	 also	 made	 him	 a
billionaire.


# Chapter	1	

## How	to	Look	at	the	Stock	Market

Value	 investors	 view	 the	 stock	 market	 differently	 than	 other	 investors.	 They
don’t	 _believe_ 	that	the	stock	market	consists	of	stocks.	They	 _know_ 	that	the	stock
market	consists	of	real	companies.	That	little	difference	changes	everything.	It
also	explains	why	value	investors	consistently	beat	the	stock	market	year	after
year.

In	this	chapter,	you	will	learn	how	to	think	differently	about	the	stock	market.
By	thinking	differently,	you	will	have	a	distinct	and	unique	advantage	that	will
lead	to	growth,	reduce	risk,	and	create	less	stress.	You	will	learn	why	it	is	good
when	stock	prices	drop,	and	why	the	wise	stock	investor	will	grow	wealthy	over
time.

##### Mr.	Market	and	bubbles	in	the	market

Have	you	met	Mr.	Market?	If	you	have	ever	traded	on	the	stock	exchange,	you
have	met	him.	If	you	have	listened	to	financial	news,	you	have	heard	about	him
for	 sure.	 Mr.	 Market	 is	 a	 fictitious	 person	 about	 whom	 the	 founder	 of	 value
investing,	 Professor	 Benjamin	 Graham,	 taught	 to	 his	 class	 at	 Columbia
University	in	the	1950s.	Perhaps	you	have	heard	of	Graham?	If	not,	I’m	sure	you
will	have	heard	of	one	of	his	brilliant	students:	his	name	is	Warren	Buffett	and
he	is	the	most	successful	stock	investor	in	history.

Mr.	Market	is	a	very	important	person	to	familiarize	yourself	with	if	you	are
serious	 about	 stock	 investing.	 Every	 day	 he	 comes	 by	 to	 visit	 you.	 When	 he
arrives,	you	can	buy	or	sell	high-and/or	low-quality	companies.	It	is	always	nice
to	get	a	visit	from	Mr.	Market.	He	doesn’t	get	offended	easily.	You	can	look	at
his	companies	as	much	as	you	want—every	day	if	you	wish—and	you	don’t
have	to	buy	or	sell	anything.	You	can	wait	as	long	as	you	would	like.	The	best
part	about	Mr.	Market	is	that	you	can	ignore	him	for	years,	yet	he	will	keep


coming	back	every	day	with	new	offers.

Sometimes	when	Mr.	Market	arrives,	he	is	in	a	good	mood.	When	this	happens,
Mr.	Market	has	a	lot	of	customers	and	the	prices	are	high	for	all	of	his	products
—both	 the	 high-quality	 and	 low-quality	 companies.	 The	 next	 day	 when	 Mr.
Market	 visits,	 there	 might	 be	 very	 few	 customers.	 As	 one	 might	 expect,	 Mr.
Market	will	not	be	in	a	good	mood.	On	these	days,	the	companies	Mr.	Market	is
selling	are	on	sale;	therefore,	the	price	for	the	exact	same	company	is	cheaper.

Yes,	you	probably	have	guessed	what	we	are	talking	about.	We	are	talking	about
the	stock	market.	The	stock	market	moves	up	and	down	every	day.	Some	may
argue	that	there	is	always	a	reason	for	stock	price	fluctuations.	They	think	the
current	 price	 always	 reflects	 the	 true	 value	 of	 the	 company.	 This	 idea	 is
especially	popular	within	academia.

Value	investors	like	 Warren	Buffett	 and	Benjamin	 Graham	strongly	 disagree.
They	believe	the	stock	market	moves	in	the	short	term	due	to	emotions	and	in
the	long	term	due	to	value.	Mr.	Market	may	be	a	fictitious	character,	but	he’s	a
symbol	of	the	emotional	psychology	the	stock	market	follows	in	the	short	term.
There	is	good	reason	to	believe	that	Warren	Buffett	is	right:	he’s	accumulated
over	60	billion	dollars	in	personal	wealth	using	value	investing.

For	 many	 investors,	 the	 stock	 market	 remains	 a	 puzzle.	 They	 see	 a	 lot	 of
different	prices	that	move	up	and	down.	They	base	their	actions	on	hope	with	the
expectation	that	they	can	buy	cheap	and	sell	high.	Now,	you’ll	notice	I	referred
to	them	as	 _investors_ .	I	would	like	to	withdraw	that.	In	my	humble	opinion,	these
people	are	 _traders.	_ The	world	has	always	had	a	lot	of	traders.	Five	hundred	years
ago,	Europeans	sailed	to	the	new	world	to	buy	tobacco	and	sell	it	for	a	higher
price	back	home.	When	you	are	shopping	for	groceries,	you	are	buying	milk	at	a
higher	 price	 than	 the	 store	 bought	 it	 for.	 Trading	 is	 a	 technique.	 It	 does	 not
matter	whether	it	is	tobacco,	milk	or	stocks.

If	you	are	a	value	investor,	you	don’t	see	a	stock.	You	see	a	company.	Many
people	 tend	 to	 forget	 that,	 when	 owning	 a	 stock,	 you	 really	 own	 an	 equally
divisible	share	of	a	real	business.	This	means	the	ownership	of	one	share	is	the
same	exact	thing	as	owning	every	share—the	value	is	completely	proportional.
The	 stock	 market	 gives	 each	 investor	 a	 unique	 opportunity	 to	 invest	 in	 real
companies—as	an	owner—and	proportionally	share	the	company’s	profits.	Now,
Warren	Buffett	may	own	a	bigger	part	of	Coca-Cola	than	you	can	afford,	but	the
principle	is	exactly	the	same.	If	you	want	to	be	a	value	investor	like	Warren


Buffett,	you	want	to	accumulate	stocks,	not	trade	them.	Benjamin	Graham	has	a
quote:	“In	the	short	run,	the	market	is	a	voting	machine,	but	in	the	long	run	it	is	a
weighing	 machine.”	 This	 profound	 statement	 signifies	 his	 ideology	 that
accumulating	 more	 shares—or	 equity—in	 the	 business	 is	 paramount	 over	 the
day-to-day	activity	of	the	market.

Another	important	thing	to	understand	about	the	stock	market	is	that	there	is
often	a	reason	stock	prices	are	moving.	That	said,	changes	in	stock	prices	don’t
necessarily	mean	that	they	are	 _logical_ 	or	 _fundamental_ .	You	often	see	stock	XYZ
increase	2%	from	one	day	to	the	next—then	drop	1%	the	day	after.	That	does	not
seem	to	puzzle	most	people.	But	if	you	think	about	it,	the	argument	you	hear
often	 makes	 no	 sense.	 Assume	 Company	 XYZ	 is	 Coca-Cola.	 You	 hear	 an
analyst	on	TV	who	says	that	the	increase	in	the	stock	price	is	because	the	latest
job	report	was	better	than	expected.	Then,	within	24	hours,	you	hear	another
analyst	 suggest	 that	 the	 same	 stock	 decreased	 in	 value	 because	 consumer
confidence	is	lower	than	the	big	investment	banks	expected.	Does	that	really
explain	why	Coca-Cola	is	more	valuable	on	one	day	than	another?	Clearly	the
answer	is	no.	If	we	were	conducting	day-to-day	valuations	of	a	small	business	on
the	streets	of	small	town	U.S.A,	it’s	quite	humorous	to	think	of	such	a	scenario.

Who	determines	the	stock	price?	Everyone	participating	in	buying	and	selling
stocks	is	influencing	the	constantly	changing	stock	prices.	Typically,	less	than
1%	of	total	ownership	is	traded	during	a	day.	Those	few	traders	are	ultimately
determining	the	current	price	through	the	supply	and	demand	of	the	shares.	Very
often,	 it	 is	 these	 same	 people	 who	 are	 _trading_ .	 The	 price	 of	 a	 company	 is
therefore	 being	 determined	 by	 hundreds	 if	 not	 thousands	 of	 factors	 each	 and
every	 day.	 Some	 traders	 have	 analytical	 justification	 for	 their	 trading;	 many
others	have	emotional	or	personal	reasons.	Again,	please	meet	Mr.	Market!

Please	note	that	I	am	talking	about	the	 _price_ ;	I	am	not	talking	about	the	 _value_ 	of
the	 stocks—not	 yet	 at	 least.	 Price	 and	 value	 are	 completely	 different	 things.
When	 Mr.	 Market	 is	 in	 high	 spirits	 and	 prices	 are	 high,	 we	 sometimes
experience	a	bubble.	It	occurs	when	there	is	no	sustainable	relationship	between
the	value	and	the	price	of	a	company.

We	 have	 seen	 a	 bubble	 burst	 in	 the	 stock	 market	 many	 times	 before.	 One
example	is	the	dot-com	bubble	in	2000	which	was	driven	by	an	overly	optimistic
faith	in	technology	companies.	The	belief	was	that	any	price	was	justifiable	to
own	such	a	business.	Like	any	other	bubble,	this	idea	was	dangerously	wrong.
Recently,	the	world	experienced	a	real-estate	bubble	which	littered	banks	with


bad	loans.	Once	again,	this	bubble	popped	and	the	situation	corrected	once	price
and	value	had	no	sustainable	relationship	to	each	other.

Why	do	these	bubbles	keep	occurring?	Have	we	learnt	nothing	from	history?
The	most	obvious	answer	must	be	no.	In	1637,	we	had	the	first	recording	of	an
economic	bubble.	It	was	in	the	Netherlands	when	“Tulipmania”	occurred.	At	the
peak	 of	 the	 bubble,	 a	 tulip	 bulb	 was	 traded	 at	 the	 price	 of	 10	 years’	 annual
income	for	a	worker,	far	greater	than	the	 _value_ 	of	a	tulip	bulb.	Today	we	might
have	a	laugh	at	the	expense	of	the	poor	Dutch	people	who	went	into	economic
ruin,	but	as	we	have	seen	twice	in	the	last	decade,	humanity	has	learned	very
little	from	historic	economic	bubbles.

We	have	experienced	economic	bubbles	on	a	regular	basis	for	a	very	long	time,
and	there’s	strong	reasoning	to	suggest	more	are	on	the	way.

The	argument	is	simple:	bubbles	are	created	by	people,	and	while	it	is	possible
to	predict	that	most	people	will	do	something	unwise	in	the	stock	market,	it	is
impossible	to	predict	for	how	long.	We	may	know	that	there	is	a	bubble,	but	we
don’t	know	when	it	will	burst.	It	may	take	years.	Many	people	have	lost	a	lot	of
money	betting	against	the	market	in	a	bubble,	and	even	if	they	were	right,	they
often	run	out	of	money	before	the	market	makes	a	correction.

Betting	 _against	_ human	behavior	is	speculating.	But	let’s	take	a	look	at	why	value
investing	 is	 about	 benefiting	 from	 human	 behavior.	 We	 will	 teach	 you	 what
Benjamin	Graham	taught	his	students:

```
“Mr.	Market	is	your	servant,	not	your	guide.” —Warren	Buffett
```
##### Good	news!	The	market	is	dropping

Do	 you	 like	 to	 shop	 for	 deals?	 I	 sure	 do!	 Who	 doesn’t	 like	 to	 buy	 a	 quality
product	at	a	cheaper	price?	I	buy	more	stuff	when	prices	are	low.	Then,	when	the
price	increases,	I	buy	less,	or	none.

It’s	funny;	when	people	buy	items	at	the	store,	this	is	likely	how	they	shop—yet,
interestingly,	when	it	comes	to	buying	stocks,	they	do	the	exact	opposite.	Why?

When	 stock	 markets	 are	 trading	 at	 high	 levels,	 you’ll	 often	 find	 people	 are
flocking	towards	the	idea	of	easy	money.	In	contrast,	when	the	market	is	down
or	performing	poorly,	common	traders	avoid	the	market	like	the	plague.	This
likely	 happens	 because	 individuals	 substitute	 group	 thinking	 for	 true
understanding	and	knowledge;	therefore,	when	the	market	is	performing	poorly,
these	 individuals	 leave	 because	 they	 inherently	 acknowledge	 that	 they	 are


dealing	with	a	situation	they	don’t	understand.	This	idea	is	important.	At	the	root
of	value	investing	is	this	fundamental	idea:	The	market	doesn’t	offer	value;	it
offers	price.	You	must	determine	value	and	you	must	always	remember	that	it	is
seldom	 a	 poor	 decision	 to	 buy	 something	 for	 $5.00	 when	 it’s	 actually	 worth
$10.00.

As	 a	 stock	 investor,	 you	 should	 almost	 always	 hope	 for	 the	 market	 to	 drop.
There	is	one	rare	exception:	when	you’re	bound	by	time.	If	you	are	looking	to
retire	within	a	year	or	two,	for	example,	and	need	access	to	a	large	portion	of
your	savings,	the	stock	market	is	probably	a	risky	place	to	have	your	money.	If
time	isn’t	a	concern,	you	should	hope	that	stocks	are	as	cheap	as	possible.

Remember	Mr.	Market?	Previously	we	saw	that	when	he	was	in	a	good	mood,
prices	were	very	high;	conversely,	when	he	was	in	a	bad	mood,	prices	were	low.
In	martial	arts,	there’s	a	term	called	Aikido.	This	means	you	use	your	opponent’s
momentum	 against	 him.	 As	 a	 value	 investor,	 you	 might	 not	 feel	 comfortable
referring	to	the	other	person	as	your	opponent,	but	there	is	definitely	symbolic
importance	to	using	the	other	person’s	momentum.	When	Mr.	Market	is	in	a	bad
mood,	it	is	the	time	to	accumulate	stock	and	start	 _using	_ the	inevitable	human
behavior	 to	 your	 advantage.	 Remember,	 poorly	 performing	 stock	 markets	 are
your	advantage—if	you	choose	and	act	on	them	wisely.


You	 know	 that	 the	 market	 price	 is	 determined	 in	 the	 short	 run	 by	 human
psychology.	At	some	point	in	time,	people	will	be	fearful	and	stocks	will	be	very
cheap.	In	contrast,	other	times	will	present	greedy	periods	where	prices	are	high.


We	can’t	predict	the	future,	but	we	can	reasonably	assume	fear	and	greed	will
continue	to	play	an	active	role	in	market	movements	in	the	future.

Stock	prices	jump	up	and	down	like	crazy.	As	a	value	investor,	you	should	not
let	this	discourage	you	in	any	way.	In	fact,	this	should	excite	you.	Mr.	Market	is
your	 servant,	 and	 the	 more	 severe	 his	 mood	 swings,	 the	 better	 deals	 you’re
afforded.	His	violent	swings	in	price	will	only	allow	you	to	buy	cheaper	and	sell
higher.

One	 important	 skill	 that	 separates	 the	 great	 investors	 from	 the	 majority	 of
mediocre	 investors	 is	 that	 great	 investors	 can	 control	 their	 emotions.	 Great
investors	like	Warren	Buffett	are	not	discouraged	when	the	stock	price	of	one	of
their	investments	drops.	When	Warren	Buffett	has	determined	that	he	is	indeed
paying	 $5.00	 for	 something	 that’s	 worth	 $10.00,	 it	 is	 great	 news	 if	 the	 price
drops	to	$4.00.	At	$4.00,	he	can	buy	even	more	shares	than	he	could	earlier.

For	most	people,	this	idea	is	counterintuitive.	If	they	buy	something,	they	hope
that	item	will	increase	in	price	shortly	after	their	purchase.	The	problem	for	these
types	of	investors	is	their	minds	are	bound	by	time.	In	order	for	value	investing
to	 work,	 you	 must	 remove	 the	 time	 element	 that	 often	 dictates	 impulsive
decisions.	 The	 best	 way	 to	 remove	 this	 impulse	 is	 to	 increase	 your	 level	 of
knowledge.	As	your	knowledge	increases,	your	confidence	improves	and	your
understanding	of	truth	and	facts	becomes	clear.	Financial	education	removes	the
time	and	impulse	element	found	in	novice	investors.	As	you	progress	throughout
this	book,	I’m	confident	you’ll	start	to	develop	a	sincere	excitement	for	bear
markets—or	slang	for	markets	moving	lower.

##### Why	stocks	will	make	you	wealthy

Stocks	are	a	simple—but	not	easy—way	of	getting	wealthy.	The	simplicity	of	a
stock	can	be	shown	by	realizing	that	when	you	own	a	stock	you	own	a	tiny	piece
of	a	real	business.	Think	of	one	share	as	its	own	entity	or	mini	business.	If	you
want	to	imagine	it	as	being	small	enough	to	fit	in	the	palm	of	your	hand,	go
ahead.	 It	 might	 actually	 make	 more	 sense	 that	 way.	 Staying	 with	 this	 visual
example,	now	imagine	that	this	palm-sized	business	makes	a	small	product;	it
has	small	employees	and	a	small	inventory.	You	can	take	this	example	as	far	as
you	would	like,	but	the	point	is	this:	one	share	produces	the	exact	same	profit	or
loss	as	the	entire	business.	This	visualization	will	really	help	later	on	when	you
think	of	owning	100	tiny	businesses	that	each	produce	a	$1	profit	and	they	each
cost	$10	to	own.


This	also	means	that	as	long	as	companies	make	a	profit	over	time,	the	owners	of
those	companies	will	eventually	accumulate	wealth.	So,	if	stocks	are	as	simple
as	I	have	just	described,	why	don’t	more	people	get	wealthy	through	the	stock
market?

Well,	most	people	would	rather	rely	on	the	promise	of	getting	rich	tomorrow
than	the	certainty	of	getting	rich	in	twenty	to	thirty	years.	This	opinion	can	be
substantiated	by	the	fact	that	more	people	play	the	lottery	than	invest	in	the	stock
market.	 Remember,	 special	 skills	 are	 not	 required	 to	 become	 wealthy	 in	 the
stock	market.

So	 as	 you	 look	 at	 the	 world	 of	 investing	 with	 an	 open	 perspective,	 you’re
probably	wondering	if	stocks	are	the	most	lucrative	path	forward.	If	that	is	your
line	of	thought,	you	should	be	proud.	Of	the	variety	of	investment	possibilities	in
this	world,	only	a	few	categories	generate	income	on	a	consistent	basis.	Stocks,
as	a	whole,	are	one	of	them.

The	distinction	between	investments	that	generate	profit	and	those	that	do	not	is
important	 to	 consider.	 A	 category	 that	 does	 not	 generate	 income	 is	 precious
metal.	Examples	could	be	gold,	silver	or	diamonds:	while	a	company	generates
wealth	back	to	the	owner	from	profit,	a	piece	of	gold	does	not	produce	anything.
There	is	no	cash	flow	generated	back	to	you.	The	only	way	you	can	make	money
in	gold	is	if	someone	thinks	that	the	piece	of	gold	is	worth	more	than	you	paid
for	it.	History	has	also	shown	that	there	is	something	to	it.	From	1900-2000,	the
Dow	Jones	went	from	66	to	11497,	while	gold	went	from	$20	to	$400.

Before	 you	 even	 start	 to	 think	 about	 entering	 a	 new	 investment,	 always	 ask:
“Does	 it	 generate	 any	 cash	 flow	 back	 to	 me?”	 You	 will	 soon	 realize	 that
investments	 like	 precious	 metals,	 wine	 and	 art	 are	 bad	 alternatives	 to	 stocks
because	they	don’t	create	consistent	cash	flow.

Now,	I	have	been	very	general	in	this	discussion	so	far.	I	have	established	why
the	stock	market	is	suitable	for	compounding	your	wealth;	however,	as	a	real
investor,	you’re	probably	not	satisfied	with	a	generic	assessment	that	“Stocks
have	always	gone	up	because	they	are	businesses.”	An	investor	also	wants	to
maximize	 his	 return	 within	 this	 investment	 category	 of	 stocks.	 In	 order	 to
accomplish	that	mission,	you	need	to	be	armed	with	a	few	economic	concepts
and	some	simple	accounting.	This	book’s	goal	is	to	provide	those	tools	for	you.


# Chapter	2	

## Concepts	Every	Investor	Should	Know

If	you	really	want	to	beat	the	stock	market,	you	should	start	studying	stocks—
right?	Learn	all	about	P/E,	ROE,	profit	ratio	and	so	on?	Well,	not	yet.

No	 investor	 has	 ever	 beaten	 the	 stock	 market	 on	 a	 consistent	 basis	 without
understanding	interest	rates,	inflation	and	bonds.	Now,	this	might	sound	like	a
dry	topic,	but	your	success	in	the	stock	market	is	intimately	tied	to	your	firm
understanding	of	this	chapter.	A	lot	of	people	try,	and	many	fail.	But	that	is	not
you.	You	have	decided	to	go	the	extra	mile	and	study	these	concepts.	And	guess
what?	There	are	seldom	traffic	jams	on	the	extra	mile.

##### Interest	rates

You	hear	about	it	in	the	news	all	the	time:	the	interest	rate.	The	interest	rate
never	seems	to	relax,	and	it’s	always	going	up	or	down.	But	what	is	the	interest
rate	 _really_ ,	and	why	is	it	important	for	you,	as	a	stock	investor?

Think	of	interest	rates	like	gravity.	Gravity	has	a	persistent	impact	on	the	way
you	live	your	life;	for	example,	whether	you	go	to	bed	or	you	run	a	marathon,
you’re	 experiencing	 gravity.	 Like	 gravity,	 the	 interest	 rate	 has	 a	 persistent
impact	on	money	and	businesses.	It	is	always	there.

Unlike	gravity,	interest	rates	fluctuate.	They	are	persistent,	or	always	there,	but
they	 are	 also	 changing	 in	 magnitude.	 To	 visualize	 this	 from	 a	 practical
standpoint,	let’s	return	to	our	analogy.


Let’s	assume	you	live	on	a	planet	where	gravity	changes	once	a	day.	The	first
day,	gravity	is	normal.	We	will	baseline	this	gravity	at	1.0.	On	this	particular
day,	you	go	about	your	normal	business	and	don’t	have	any	issues.	As	we	move


to	the	next	day,	something	interesting	happens:	gravity	goes	higher.	It	moves	to
2.0.	This	means	that	everything	is	twice	as	heavy	and	difficult	to	lift	and	move.
On	the	second	day,	you	find	yourself	less	willing	to	run	and	work	because	it
takes	twice	the	amount	of	work	to	do	the	same	job	as	the	previous	day.	Finally,
as	we	move	to	the	third	day,	gravity	experiences	a	sharp	change	and	it’s	now	at
0.50.	 This	 is	 a	 very	 interesting	 change	 and	 dynamic	 for	 you	 to	 experience
because	everything	is	extremely	light	and	easy	to	move.	Your	body	and	objects
weigh	¼	that	of	the	previous	day.	This	extreme	difference	promotes	your	ability
to	run	faster	and	perform	more	work.	Needless	to	say,	life	becomes	really	easy.

As	 we	 look	 at	 this	 odd	 example,	 it	 has	 significant	 importance	 to	 your
fundamental	understanding	of	financial	markets:	interest	rates	work	like	gravity.

When	interest	rates	rise,	business	becomes	more	difficult	and	vulnerable.	This	is
because	businesses	can’t	borrow	money	at	cheap	and	affordable	prices.	When
interest	rates	decrease,	business	becomes	easier	and	less	vulnerable.	The	value	of
previously	 held	 assets	 increases	 because	 more	 and	 more	 people	 can	 borrow
money,	which	increases	demand,	and	their	monthly	payments	are	now	lower	if
they	need	to	borrow	money	to	buy.

Businesses	experience	interest	rates	in	this	manner.	When	interest	rates	rise,	only
the	 strongest	 and	 fittest	 business	 can	 endure	 the	 change.	 Their	 profits	 are
handicapped	by	their	inability	to	move	and	remain	agile.

Moving	into	the	more	technical	description	of	interest	rates,	you	can	think	of	it
as	the	 _price	of	money_ .	Imagine	that	you	have	just	found	a	beautiful	new	house
and	you	are	looking	at	two	different	funding	options.	One	bank	offers	you	a
thirty-year	mortgage	of	6%	and	another	bank	offers	a	similar	loan	at	4%.	If	the
seller	wants	$300,000	for	the	house,	your	total	annual	interest	payment	for	the
house	would	be	$18,000	and	$12,000	respectively.	Don’t	think	about	the	math
for	now;	just	realize	that	the	lower	interest	rate	makes	the	house	more	affordable
to	more	people	than	the	6%	rate.	This	increased	affordability	at	4%	allows	more
buyers	 into	 the	 market	 for	 the	 $300,000	 house,	 increasing	 demand	 and
potentially	the	asking	price	($300,000).	As	you	can	see,	the	price	of	the	house
remained	fixed	at	$300,000,	but	the	value	did	not.	As	we	look	at	the	possibility
of	the	asking	price	increasing	due	to	demand	at	the	lower	interest	rate,	this	is	a
slow	 process	 that	 may	 take	 months	 or	 years.	 As	 you	 can	 see,	 the	 difference
between	interest	rates	creates	a	disparity	between	price	and	value.	This	disparity
is	where	an	investor	makes	money—especially	in	the	stock	market.


That	sounds	simple	doesn’t	it?	Well,	interest	rates	 _can_ 	be	very	simple,	and	the
basic	principle	is	always	the	same:	the	borrower	has	to	pay	the	interests	to	the
lender,	and	the	interest	rate	is	specified	when	the	agreement	is	made.

When	you	hear	about	interest	rates	in	the	news,	it	is	most	often	the	“government
bond	 interest	 rate,”	 which	 is	 determined	 by	 the	 United	 States	 Federal	 (FED)
Reserve.	 The	 FED	 is	 an	 independent	 organization	 that	 manages	 the	 money
supply	and	fiscal	policy	for	the	U.S.	Government.	Almost	all	modern	countries
have	their	own	federal	reserve.	One	of	the	most	important	jobs	of	the	Federal
Reserve	 is	 to	 influence	 interest	 rates	 for	 their	 citizens.	 Now,	 there’s	 a	 huge
debate	about	whether	the	Federal	Reserve	creates	stability	or	instability	for	the
economy	by	adjusting	interest	rates,	but	that’s	not	important.	As	an	investor,	the
important	thing	to	understand	is	that	the	FED	purposely	adjusts	the	interest	rates
to	improve	and	slow	the	growth	of	the	economy.	Without	controlling	this	rate,
many	 argue	 the	 financial	 system(s)	 may	 collapse	 due	 to	 enormous	 market
bubbles	or	lack	of	credit/cash	in	the	system.	Every	time	interest	rates	change,	so
does	 the	 disparity	 between	 price	 and	 value—therefore	 creating	 potential
opportunities.

As	a	stock	investor,	it	is	extremely	important	to	keep	an	eye	on	the	interest	rate.
You	should	act	differently	in	the	stock	market	when	the	interest	is	low	compared
to	when	it	is	high.	Why?	To	answer	this	question,	let’s	look	at	how	interest	rates
are	generally	determined.

Imagine	 that	 you	 just	 found	 the	 TV	 of	 your	 dreams.	 It	 is	 60	 inches,	 smooth
design	and	the	picture	is	sharp	as	a	razor.	Unfortunately,	it	costs	$1,000	and	you
don’t	 have	 that	 kind	 of	 money	 for	 a	 TV.	 The	 store	 clerk	 then	 gives	 you	 an
amazing	offer:	get	the	TV	on	credit!	No	down	payment,	and	he	will	even	arrange
free	delivery.	Looking	at	the	terms	and	conditions,	you	see	that	the	interest	rate
is	20%;	in	other	words,	the	price	of	money	is	very	high.	You	will	need	to	pay
$200	every	year	for	the	rest	of	your	life	if	you	don’t	pay	off	the	principal!	The
TV	does	not	look	so	good	now,	does	it?

We	saw	earlier	that	the	interest	rate	of	a	mortgage	was	as	low	as	4%.	Why	is
there	such	a	difference	in	cost	for	borrowers?	Is	the	bank	just	a	friendlier	lender
than	the	store	clerk	in	the	electronic	store?	No,	the	reason	is	 _risk_ .	With	the	house,
the	bank	can	simply	repossess	the	house	and	recover	a	large	portion	of	their	loan
if	you	default	on	the	loan.	With	the	TV,	it’s	a	different	story.	A	used	TV	may
only	fetch	half	the	value	it	was	previously	sold	for.	Within	a	few	years,	the	TV
may	be	worth	a	hundred	dollars.	Since	the	interest	rate	is	the	price	of	money,	it	is


also	how	the	lenders	adjust	to	financial	circumstances,	which	is	then	reflected	in
your	financial	behavior	as	a	consumer.

The	FED	determines	the	interest	rate	in	a	similar	way.	They	look	at	risk	and	how
to	adjust	financial	behavior;	however,	they	do	it	on	a	much	larger	 _macro_ 	scale.
The	 FED	 is	 not	 only	 looking	 at	 you,	 but	 at	 the	 whole	 economy.	 In	 times	 of
recession,	the	government	wants	us	to	spend	more	money.	It	achieves	this	by
lowering	the	price	of	money.	In	other	words,	it	lowers	interest	rates.	This	is	an
incentive	 to	 spend	 more	 money.	 When	 more	 money	 is	 spent,	 it	 will	 increase
consumption,	which	in	turn	will	lead	to	employment	and	higher	wealth	in	the
economy.	 When	 interest	 rates	 are	 low,	 companies	 can	 borrow	 for	 less.	 This
makes	new	investments	more	attractive,	which	again	leads	to	more	employment
and	higher	wealth.	When	money	is	cheap,	typically	stocks	are	too.	This	is	the
most	important	time	to	accumulate	as	many	shares	as	you	can.

When	times	are	good,	the	government	wants	it	to	continue.	They	achieve	this	by
trying	to	avoid	a	bubble	in	the	market—so	they	increase	the	price	of	money,	or
increase	interest	rates.	When	things	get	expensive,	we	tend	to	buy	less.	That	is
not	 only	 true	 for	 TVs	 and	 houses;	 we	 adjust	 our	 financial	 behavior	 to	 all
consumption.	As	with	the	electronic	store	that	is	lending	you	money	for	a	TV,
the	risk	and	thereby	the	interest	rate	is	high.	Citizens	really	do	not	want	a	bubble,
and	even	less	a	bubble	that	bursts,	because	it	creates	instability	in	the	economy.
As	 a	 successful	 stock	 investor,	 bubbles	 and	 interest	 rate	 swings	 present
enormous	opportunities.

If	 you	 want	 to	 master	 the	 stock	 market,	 start	 with	 a	 firm	 understanding	 of
interest	rates.	It’s	truly	the	foundation	to	the	entire	economic	cycle	and	 _value_ 	of
everything	on	the	planet.	Remember,	there’s	a	big	difference	between	price	and
value,	and	interest	rates	are	the	key	ingredient	to	their	disparity.	Determining	this
difference	will	be	the	ultimate	key	to	your	success.

##### Inflation

You	want	to	become	a	millionaire?	The	good	news	is	that	it’s	easier	for	you	than
your	grandparents.

You	guessed	it;	I	am	talking	about	inflation.	Every	year,	the	prices	of	goods	and
services	increase	a	little.	We	are	only	talking	a	few	percentage	points,	but	when
you	add	it	all	up,	$1	in	1913	would	cost	as	much	as	$23.49	in	2013.

Why	 do	 we	 have	 inflation	 at	 all?	 Is	 inflation	 good?	 And	 why	 is	 this	 even
remotely	interesting	for	you	as	a	stock	investor?


First	things	first!	Let’s	discuss	why	we	have	inflation.	To	start	this	discussion,
we	would	like	to	ask	you	whether	you	would	like	to	buy	your	groceries	today	for
$100	or	the	exact	same	basket	of	goods	tomorrow	for	$103?	What	would	you
do?	Well,	most	likely	you	would	choose	to	buy	the	goods	today.	I	would	do	the
same!	Let’s	buy	it	cheap!

Inflation	works	in	the	same	way,	though	not	quite	as	fast.	The	government	likes
a	little	inflation	for	three	reasons.	The	first	reason	is	that	you	consume	more,	and
as	a	result,	your	purchases	start	generating	employment	and	wealth	in	society.

You	might	wait	longer	than	one	day,	but	the	same	basket	of	groceries	that	cost
$100	today	will	at	some	point	cost	$103.	The	way	the	Federal	Reserve	does	this
is	through	increasing	the	number	of	dollars	in	the	economic	system.	Simply	put,
they	 keep	 adding	 more	 and	 more	 dollars	 to	 the	 system	 so	 the	 prices	 slowly
increase	over	time.	An	important	notion	you	need	to	understand	is	the	difference
between	 nominal	 dollars	 and	 real	 dollars.	 Nominal	 dollars	 don’t	 account	 for
inflation.	Real	dollars	do.	So	if	Grandpa	says	he	earned	$1	an	hour	in	1913,	he’s
actually	saying	that	he	earned	$1	nominal	dollar.	If	Grandpa	was	an	economics
major,	 he	 might	 say	 he	 earned	 $1	 nominal	 dollar	 an	 hour	 in	 1913,	 which	 is
equivalent	to	$23.49	real	dollars	(or	today	dollars).

The	second	reason	the	government	likes	a	little	inflation	is	that	you	are	being
taxed	on	nominal	dollars.	Let’s	take	an	example:	You	just	bought	an	asset	for
$100,000.	Next	year,	the	price	of	the	asset	is	$102,000	due	to	inflation	of	2%.
There	is	no	real	appreciation	on	the	value	of	the	asset,	but	since	you	get	taxed	on
the	growth	on	the	nominal	value	(the	$2,000	gain),	the	inflation	itself	taxes	you.
You	can	also	look	at	it	like	this:	You	can	sell	your	asset	a	year	after,	but	you	will
not	be	able	to	buy	more	for	that	money.	Actually,	you	have	a	little	less	since	you
need	to	pay	your	taxes!

The	third	reason	is	that	debt	is	issued	in	nominal	terms.	As	you	probably	know,
the	U.S.	Government	has	a	lot	of	debt.	That	enormous	amount	of	debt	is	easier	to
pay	back	as	time	marches	on	because	the	money	supply	gradually	inflates.	We
will	look	in	greater	detail	at	the	concept	of	 _real dollars_ 	versus	 _nominal	dollars_ 	in
just	a	bit.

From	 a	 government	 standpoint,	 inflation	 seems	 good,	 doesn’t	 it?	 It	 might	 be
advantageous	for	a	government,	but	not	for	the	individual	investor.	From	your
vantage	point,	inflation	is	a	constant	drag	or	friction	on	your	ability	to	make
returns.


Too	 much	 inflation	 creates	 uncertainty,	 and	 that	 is	 not	 good	 for	 lenders,
companies,	consumers	or	the	exchange	rate.	There	will	be	fewer	investments	and
spending,	 which,	 as	 we	 have	 just	 learned,	 is	 not	 good	 for	 employment	 and
general	wealth	in	society.	Too	much	inflation	also	means	that	people	living	on
fixed	incomes,	such	as	pension	benefits,	experience	less	buying	power	for	their
money	as	time	goes	on.	This	brings	us	back	to	the	concept	of	 _real	dollars.	_ We
are	interested	in	what	we	can	buy	for	our	money—not	how	much	money	we
have.	Or	if	you	are	in	debt,	like	our	government,	you	are	also	interested	in	the
_real	_ value	of	your	debt.	When	talking	about	inflation	and	the	difference	between
real	and	nominal	dollars,	one	should	really	consider	what	money	is.

What	is	money?	Well,	money	is	just	what	we	agree	it	is	in	society.	There	has
always	been	some	sort	of	currency.	Native	Americans	used	wampum.	The	only
reason	dollars	are	of	any	value	is	because	we	know	that	you	and	everybody	else
in	society	have	a	common	understanding	and	trust	in	the	value	of	dollars.

We	only	value	dollars	with	respect	to	what	we	can	buy	with	them.	That	is	the
real	value	of	the	dollar.	That	is	why	it	is	so	important,	as	a	stock	investor,	that
you	understand	inflation.	To	get	a	rough	estimate,	the	math	is	pretty	simple:	if
you	make	a	10%	nominal	return	on	your	stocks	one	year	and	inflation	is	2%,	you
have	a	real	return	of	approximately	8%.

That	actually	adds	up	to	a	lot	over	time.	If	you	invested	$1	in	a	10%	stock	in
1913,	you	would	now	have	as	much	as	$13,781	a	century	later;	however,	if	you
subtracted	 annualized	 inflation	 of	 2%,	 you	 would	 only	 have	 $2,200	 in	 real
dollars	in	2013!

Even	though	inflation	diminishes	your	return,	being	a	stock	investor	is	not	as	bad
as	it	sounds.	For	one	thing,	you	can’t	do	anything	about	inflation;	it	diminishes
your	 return	 no	 matter	 what	 you	 invest	 in.	 In	 general,	 debts	 (or	 bonds)	 are
completely	impacted	by	inflation,	and	stocks	are	partially	impacted	by	inflation.
As	we	advance	through	the	book,	you’ll	understand	why.

##### Bonds

What	is	sexy	and	can	get	you	rich	in	less	than	a	year?	I	would	certainly	like	to
know	the	answer	if	you	have	one!	I	am	certain	the	answer	is	not	bonds.	That
said,	I	am	certain	that	your	understanding	of	bonds	is	equally	as	important	as
your	understanding	of	stocks	and	interest	rates.

What	does	history	tell	us	about	the	return	for	bonds	compared	to	stocks?


```
Par	value $1000
Term 30	years
Coupon	rate 5%
```
From	1928-2011,	long-term	bonds	averaged	5.4%	and	stocks	averaged	11.2%.
_So	why	get	so	excited	about	bonds?_ 	you	might	ask.	Doesn’t	this	statistic	tell	us
that	we	should	put	all	of	our	money	into	stocks	instead	of	bonds?	Well,	from
2002-2011,	long-term	bonds	averaged	yearly	returns	of	6.85%	and	stocks	4.93%,
so	the	picture	is	not	so	clear.	What	this	shows	us	is	that	sometimes	bonds	are	the
preferred	choice—and	sometimes	stocks	are.

So,	let’s	dig	into	it	and	see	what	bonds	are	really	about.	A	bond	is	a	loan.	Yes,	it
is	that	simple!	A	bond	is	just	an	agreement	that	you	are	lending	someone	else
money.	It	could	be	a	company	or	the	government.	I	personally	like	the	idea	of
the	government	owing	us	money	for	a	change!

In	 any	 case,	 the	 borrower	 has	 an	 obligation	 to	 pay	 back	 your	 loan.	 A	 bond
consists	of	three	simple	components:

```
Par	value	or	face	value.	This	is	the	amount	that	the	bond	is	issued	for.
Also,	the	par	value	is	the	amount	you	get	back	when	the	bond	matures.
Term.	This	is	the	duration	of	the	bond	until	it	matures.
Coupon	or	Interest	rate.	The	amount	of	money	that	you	get	back	every
year	as	a	percentage	of	the	par	value.
```
Let’s	take	a	simple	example	to	show	how	bonds	work:

So,	in	this	situation,	you	will	lend	out	$1,000	to	own	the	bond.	The	term	of	the
ownership	(or	loan)	is	30	years.	For	your	courtesy,	you	will	receive	$50	each
year	until	it	matures	30	years	later.	Also,	at	the	end	of	those	30	years,	you’ll	get
the	par	value	of	$1,000	back.	In	total	you	will	receive	$2,500	(30	years	x	$50	+
$1,000).	This	equates	to	a	$1,500	profit	in	nominal	dollars.

Now,	this	is	where	it	gets	very	interesting.	We	have	just	learned	about	interest
rates	and	inflation	and	why	these	are	important	for	you	as	a	stock	investor.

We	have	also	learned	that	the	interest	rate	was	the	 _price	of	money_ .	So	when	the
interest	rate	is	high,	the	price	of	money	is	also	high.	That	means	that	if	you’re
the	lender	(or	bond	purchaser),	you	will	receive	more	money	from	the	borrower
(or	bond	seller)	if	interest	rates	across	the	market	are	generally	high.

Now,	we	are	not	only	talking	about	the	government	interest	rate.	Companies	can


also	 issue	 bonds	 and	 have	 their	 own	 interest	 rates.	 As	 one	 might	 expect,	 an
unhealthy	company	will	issue	bonds	at	a	higher	interest	rate	than	healthy	ones.
In	fact,	company	rates	are	often	higher	than	those	of	the	government	because
companies	are	more	likely	to	fail.

Does	this	mean	you	should	be	investing	in	bonds	rather	than	stock	when	interest
rates	 are	 high?	 Perhaps!	 To	 answer	 that	 question,	 we	 also	 need	 to	 consider
inflation	and	expected	yields	of	all	opportunities.

Going	back	to	the	previous	example	where	we	had	a	$1,000	bond	with	a	5%
coupon	(or	$50	a	year),	let’s	look	at	how	a	5%	inflation	rate	would	impact	this
investment.	 Throughout	 the	 duration	 of	 that	 thirty-year	 bond,	 the	 government
would	be	inflating	the	value	of	the	currency	so	rapidly	that	your	5%	coupon
growth	would	be	completely	offset	by	the	5%	inflation.	As	a	result,	your	real
return	would	be	nothing.	Now,	you	would	still	receive	your	par	value	of	$1,000
back	at	the	end	of	the	30	years,	and	you	would	still	receive	$1,500	in	coupon
payments	 over	 the	 30-year	 period,	 but	 your	 purchasing	 power	 will	 remain
unchanged.

**Takeaways	from	this	chapter**

Let	me	summarize	 the	interaction	 between	interest	rates,	 inflation,	bonds	 and
stocks	here:

```
Low	interest	rates High	interest	rates
Low	inflation Stocks Bonds
High	inflation Stocks Stocks
```
Bonds	are	preferred	in	the	situation	where	inflation	is	low	and	interest	rates	are
high.	That	is	partly	because	inflation	diminishes	the	fixed	income	received	from
bonds,	but	also	because	a	high-interest	environment	may	yield	better	returns.	In
all	other	cases,	stocks	are	likely	the	preferred	choice.	As	the	book	progresses,	I’ll
provided	 more	 definitive	 guidance	 on	 which	 type	 of	 investment	 you	 should
consider	and	why.


# Chapter	3	

## A	Brief	Introduction	to	Financial	Statements

For	 most	 people,	 financial	 reports	 are	 as	 interesting	 as	 looking	 at	 paint	 dry.
Some	 might	 even	 say	 that	 paint	 is	 more	 interesting	 since	 we	 understand	 the
function	of	paint.	Financial	reports,	on	the	other	hand...	What	is	the	purpose	of
them?	 Before	 I	 answer	 that	 relatively	 simple	 question,	 let’s	 get	 one	 thing
straight:	Financial	statements	are	not	as	complicated	as	you	might	think!	You
may	 need	 to	 think	 a	 little	 differently	 than	 you	 are	 used	 to,	 but	 with	 a	 little
practice	and	guidance	you	will	be	amazed	how	simple	they	really	are.

In	 the	 second	 half	 of	 the	 book,	 I	 will	 go	 in	 depth	 into	 each	 line	 of	 various
financial	 statements	 and	 speak	 more	 about	 how	 the	 different	 statements	 are
related.	But	before	that,	this	chapter	will	give	you	a	quick	and	easy	overview	of
the	content	found	in	financial	statements.

You	can	look	at	financial	statements	as	systematic	reports	that	inform	you	about
the	successes	or	failures	of	a	company.	At	the	end	of	the	day,	there’s	nothing
more	important	to	consider	when	you’re	looking	to	own	a	business—i.e.,	how
does	this	company	make	a	profit	and	what	are	they	currently	worth.	If	I	wanted
to	make	financial	statements	about	you,	I	would	write	down	on	a	piece	of	paper
how	 much	 money	 you	 made	 and	 how	 much	 you	 spent.	 On	 another	 piece	 of
paper,	I	might	keep	track	of	your	long-term	savings	and	debts—like	the	balance
on	 your	 IRA	 account	 or	 mortgage.	 And	 perhaps	 on	 a	 third	 piece	 of	 paper,	 I
might	 keep	 track	 of	 every	 transaction	 you’ve	 made	 from	 your	 cash	 and/or
checking	account.	These	three	pieces	of	paper	would	really	give	me	a	good	idea
about	your	current	worth	and	what	earnings	capacity	you	potentially	have.

That	sounds	simple—right?	It	is	simple	and	it	is	really	the	essence	of	financial
statements.	When	you	collect	these	three	pieces	of	paper	in	one	major	pool	of
information,	you	have	a	report	about	your	personal	finances.	Companies	do	the
same	thing	about	their	finances:	they	consolidate	every	piece	of	information	into
a	big	report,	and	refer	to	that	as	their	quarterly	or	annual	report.


In	 an	 annual	 report,	 you	 will	 see	 several	 important	 statements	 of	 varying
relevance.	The	three	most	important	reports	are	called	the	income	statement,	the
balance	sheet	and	the	cash	flow	statement.	When	you	start	looking	into	value
investing,	these	are	really	the	main	statements	to	focus	on.	Let’s	take	a	brief	look
at	each	of	them.

##### The	income	statement

How	much	profit	does	a	company	make	in	one	year?	That	is	really	the	question
that	is	being	asked	in	the	income	statement.	If	you	see	an	income	statement	for	a
company,	it	may	look	confusing	with	all	the	technical	accounting	terms.

Although	 this	 might	 seem	 intimidating,	 Chapter	 6	 explains	 each	 of	 the
accounting	terms	in	detail.	For	now,	all	you	need	to	keep	in	mind	is	that	the
income	statement	is	determining	how	much	profit	the	company	has	made	in	one
year	 (for	 an	 annual	 report).	 That	 is	 also	 why	 the	 income	 statement	 is	 often
referred	to	as	the	profit	and	loss	statement.	It	summarizes	how	much	money	the
company	has	made	during	the	year	and	how	much	it	has	spent.	The	difference	is
the	profit	(or	the	loss),	which	you	can	find	at	the	very	bottom.	Profit,	earnings—
more	commonly	known	as	net	income—are	all	terms	for	the	same	thing.	It’s
important	that	you	remember	those	three	terms.

```
Income	statement in	millions
1 Revenue 13,279
2 Cost	of	revenue 5,348
1-2	=	3 Gross	Margin 7,931
```
```
4 Sales	and	Marketing	expenses 1,105
5 Research	and	development	expenses 863
6 General	and	Administration	expenses 538
7 Other	operating	expenses 1,350
4+5+6+7	=	8 Operating	expenses 3,856
```
```
3-8	=	9 Income	from	operations 4,075
```
```
10 Net	interest	income/(expenses) (135)
11 Extraordinary	income/(expenses) 275
```

```
12 Income	taxes 1,352
9+10+11-12	=	13 Net	income 2,863
```
Another	way	of	looking	at	the	income	statement	is	to	consider	your	personal
finances.	The	principle	is	exactly	the	same.	If	I	asked	you	how	much	money	you
made	last	year	from	your	job,	you	may	answer	$20,000.	That	is	your	revenue.
This	would	be	the	top	line	of	the	income	statement	for	you.

Basically,	 all	 other	 transactions	 during	 a	 year	 except	 your	 paycheck	 are
expenses.	You	typically	have	different	types	of	expenses	from	your	daily	living.
Everybody	has	expenses	for	either	rent	or	mortgage.	You	need	new	clothes	from
time	to	time,	and	you	obviously	need	to	eat.	There	is	also	a	variety	of	different
expenses	that	you	cannot	avoid	one	way	or	the	other,	and	here	I	have	called	them
“other	expenses.”	Below,	I	have	prepared	a	simple	income	statement	to	illustrate
what	your	personal	income	statement	might	look	like.

```
Salary $	20,000
```
```
Housing	expenses $	-10,000
Clothing $	-1,000
Food $	-3,000
Other	expenses $	-2,500
```
```
Profit	(Loss) $	3,500
```
As	you	can	see,	the	resemblance	between	the	income	statement	for	your	personal
finances	and	that	of	a	company	is	very	similar.	A	company	would	label	your
annual	salary	 _revenue_ .	As	a	private	person,	you	may	make	your	annual	salary
from	working	at	a	restaurant.	The	restaurant’s	income	statement	would	label	its
sale	of	hamburgers	as	 _revenue_.

While	you	will	have	expenses	for	housing,	clothes	and	food,	the	restaurant	will
also	 have	 expenses,	 but	 may	 label	 these	 as	 _production	 costs_ or	 _selling	 and
administration	costs_ .	 As	 you	 already	 know,	 expenses	 are	 subtracted	 from	 the
salary	(individual)	or	revenue	(company).	The	difference	between	the	revenue
and	 expenses	 is	 what	 the	 company	 calls	 _net	 income_ or	 _net	 profit_ .	 This	 is
obviously	a	very	important	number.

In	accounting	and	investing,	income	(or	earnings)	is	often	dividend	into	a	per
share	basis	which	is	called	earnings	per	share	(EPS).	If	the	above	example	was


showing	 earnings	 from	 a	 company	 with	 100	 shares,	 the	 EPS	 would	 be
$3,500/100	=	$35.	If	we	were	going	to	find	the	EPS	of	the	real	income	statement
initially	displayed,	we	would	take	the	net	income	of	$2,863	and	divided	it	by	the
number	 of	 shares	 outstanding.	 Assuming	 the	 shares	 outstanding	 are	 100	 (for
simplicity),	the	EPS	would	be	$28.63.	This	is	an	extremely	important	number
because	it	represents	the	profit	of	the	company	for	each	share.

Keep	this	very	basic	foundation	at	the	forefront	of	your	mind	as	I	explain	the
income	statement	in	detail	during	Chapter	6.

##### The	balance	sheet

“How	 much	 am	 I	 really	 worth”?	 That’s	 an	 interesting	 question,	 isn’t	 it?	 The
main	purpose	of	the	balance	sheet	is	to	answer	that	question.	If	you	look	at	a
balance	sheet	for	a	company,	it	may	look	something	like	this:


I	know.	It	may	look	very	complicated,	and	there	are	a	lot	of	new	accounting
terms	 that	 you	 might	 have	 never	 seen.	 But	 in	 essence,	 the	 company	 is	 just
asking,	“How	much	am	I	worth	right	now?”

Again,	I	think	that	we	should	return	to	your	personal	finances	to	see	how	simple
a	balance	sheet	really	is.	I	want	you	to	list	all	your	personal	belongings	that	you
currently	 have.	 These	 are	 called	 _assets_ because	 they	 are	 something	 you	 own.


Okay,	start	writing	everything	down:

Car											$20,000
Home							$150,000
Furniture			$2,500
etc...

Then	you	should	consider	how	much	debt	you	have	attached	to	each	of	these
assets.	 We	 call	 these	 _liabilities_ because	 they	 are	 something	 that	 you	 owe	 to
somebody	else.	This	could	be	the	car	dealership,	the	bank,	or	any	place	you	have
incurred	 debt	 to	 finance	 your	 assets.	 Assuming	 you	 have	 your	 car	 and	 home
partially	financed,	your	balance	sheet	may	look	something	like	this:

So	now	we	know	the	value	of	what	you	own,	and	how	much	you	have	borrowed
to	be	able	to	buy	these	assets.	We	only	need	to	complete	one	simple	step	before
we	are	done:	we	need	to	make	the	balance	sheet...	balance.	The	total	assets	must
equal	the	total	liabilities—which	is	not	the	case	at	the	moment.	The	idea	behind
this	is	very	simple:	the	assets	are	what	you	own,	and	they	are	financed	by	two,
and	only	two,	options.

You	can	finance	your	assets	with	other	people’s	money—for	example,	the	bank.
We	call	this	a	 _liability_ .	Or	you	can	finance	them	with	your	own	money,	and	we
call	 this	 _equity	_ or	 sometimes	 _shareholders’	 equity.	_ Equity	 is	 very	 easy	 to
calculate	as	it	is	the	difference	between	what	you	own	(assets),	and	what	you
have	 borrowed	 (liabilities).	 In	 this	 example,	 we	 would	 calculate	 it	 like	 this:
$173,000-$135,000	=	$38,000

If	we	insert	the	difference,	it	looks	like	this:


Now	 the	 balance	 sheet	 is	 complete.	 And	 we	 have	 an	 answer	 to	 our	 original
question:	“How	much	am	I	really	worth?”	The	answer	in	this	generic	example	is
$38,000.

Balance	sheets	for	companies	work	the	same	way.	Companies	may	own	more
cars	 and	 buildings,	 but	 the	 principles	 are	 exactly	 the	 same	 for	 their	 balance
sheets.

I	like	to	think	about	the	balance	sheet	like	this:	An	asset	is	what	the	company
owns.	 These	 assets	 are	 either	 financed	 with	 their	 own	 money	 (equity)	 or	 by
someone	else’s	money;	for	example,	the	bank	(liabilities).

Then	 you	 might	 ask,	 _Why	 is	 equity	 grouped	 with	 liabilities?_ Since	 it	 is	 the
company’s	money,	should	it	not	be	under	assets?	The	answer	is	very	simple!
Equity	or	shareholders’	equity	does	not	technically	belong	to	the	company;	it
simply	belongs	to	the	shareholders.	In	other	words,	the	equity	is	a	liability	to	the
company	because	that	is	what	the	company	owes	to	the	shareholders.

In	investing	and	accounting,	equity	is	often	referred	to	as	book	value.	In	order	to
determine	the	book	value,	you’ll	need	to	divide	the	equity	into	a	per	share	basis.
Looking	at	the	balance	sheet	that	was	initially	presented	in	this	section,	you	can
calculate	its	book	value	by	finding	the	equity	of	$18,398	(found	on	line	15	of	the
liabilities	 column).	 Take	 that	 number	 and	 divide	 it	 by	 the	 number	 of	 shares
outstanding.	 For	 demonstration	 purposes,	 let’s	 assume	 the	 company	 has	 100
shares	outstanding.	This	means	our	book	value	(or	equity	per	share)	would	be
18,398/100	=	$183.98.	This	is	a	very	important	number	to	understand,	so	make
sure	you	don’t	move	forward	until	you	understand	this	concept.	At	the	bottom	of
every	 income	 statement	 and	 balance	 sheet,	 you’ll	 find	 an	 area	 that	 states	 the
number	of	shares	outstanding.

If	you	understood	everything	in	this	short	explanation,	you’re	off	to	a	great	start.
Feel	 free	 to	 return	 to	 this	 short	 section	 if	 you	 get	 confused	 by	 the	 details	 in


Chapter	7	and	beyond.	This	foundation	is	extremely	important.

##### The	cash	flow	statement

“Cash	 is	 King.”	 Many	 people	 have	 heard	 this	 expression	 about	 finance	 and
investing,	and	perhaps	wondered	why	something	so	obvious	has	drawn	so	much
attention.	You	seldom	hear	people	say,	“I	like	sunshine	better	than	rain”	or,	“I
would	rather	be	full	than	hungry.”	Since	we	obviously	would	rather	have	cash
than	 _not_ 	have	it,	what	does	“Cash	is	King”	mean?

To	understand	this	simple	expression,	one	needs	to	take	a	look	at	a	company’s
cash	flow	statement.	It	may	look	something	like	this:



Again,	 on	 the	 surface,	 this	 looks	 complicated,	 but	 after	 a	 little	 practice,	 it
becomes	very	simple.	First,	let’s	take	another	look	at	your	personal	finances.
Once	a	month,	you	get	a	paycheck	from	your	employer.	During	the	same	month,
you	have	a	variety	of	expenses	you	need	to	pay.	It’s	not	much	different	than
what	 we	 saw	 in	 the	 income	 statement.	 You	 need	 to	 pay	 for	 your	 housing
expenses,	clothing	and	food,	and	you	usually	pay	for	these	expenses	in	cash.	It
does	not	need	to	be	cash	in	the	sense	that	you	can	touch	it	and	it	is	in	your
pocket.	But	it	is	cash	that	you	have	full	access	to;	for	example,	your	personal
bank	 account.	 You	 can	 also	 look	 at	 your	 personal	 cash	 flow	 statement	 as
something	that	measures	the	actual	flow	of	cash	that	you	have	available.

This	 also	 explains	 why	 there	 are	 some	 important	 distinctions.	 If	 you	 buy
something	on	credit,	you	can	buy	bigger,	more	expensive	things	that	you	might
not	have	the	cash	for.	This	could,	for	instance,	be	the	purchase	of	a	brand	new
TV.	Say	that	the	price	is	$2,000;	you	might	need	to	pay	only	$200	a	month	for
the	next	ten	months.	This	means	that,	even	though	you	have	something	worth
$2,000	in	your	home,	in	your	personal	cash	flow	statement,	only	$200	would	be
deducted	the	following	month.

Your	monthly	cash	flow	statement	may	look	something	like	this:

Credit	 considerations	 are	 important	 for	 all	 companies	 too.	 Companies	 have
numerous	daily	transactions	in	which	they	either	obtain	credit	from	a	supplier	or
give	credit	to	a	customer.	This	enables	purchases	and	sales	to	be	made—and	that


is	what	you	see	in	the	income	statement.	But	the	flow	of	cash	occurs	later,	and
that	is	what	the	company’s	cash	flow	statement	tells	us.

Although	you	might	have	a	well-paid	job	that	covers	your	daily	expenses	with
an	adequate	margin,	you	may	still	experience	a	tightening	in	your	budget	during
Christmas	and	holidays.

Cash	flow	statements	work	the	same	way	for	companies:	they	measure	how	cash
is	moving	in	and	out	of	the	company.	As	such,	the	company	can	always	track
how	much	cash	it	has,	thereby	avoiding	the	unfortunate	situation	where	it	has	no
cash	 to	 pay	 creditors,	 employees	 or	 any	 other	 third	 party.	 That	 is	 not	 very
different	to	you	being	more	careful	at	the	end	of	the	month	when	your	personal
account	starts	to	show	a	lower	level	of	cash.	Cash	is	indeed	king	for	everyone.

At	first	glance,	the	income	statement	and	cash	flow	statement	might	seem	very
similar.	In	many	ways,	they	are.	But	the	key	difference	is	the	income	statement
is	capturing	the	profit	of	the	business	over	time,	and	the	cash	flow	statement	is
looking	at	the	changes	in	cash	over	time.	Your	personal	income	statement,	for
example,	might	tell	me	that	you	made	a	profit	of	$20,000	last	year,	whereas	your
personal	cash	flow	statement	would	show	me	that	you	kept	a	$1,000	balance	in
your	 checking	 account	 throughout	 the	 year.	 I	 will	 explain	 the	 cash	 flow
statement	in	much	greater	detail	in	Chapter	8.

**Basic	report	terminology	for	the	stock	investor**

There	are	a	few	things	that	are	nice	to	know	when	you	start	to	learn	more	about
accounting.	Financial	statements,	as	we	just	saw,	are	separate	components	that,
when	 combined,	 are	 called	 10Ks	 (annual),	 10Qs	 (quarterly)	 and	 8Ks
(unscheduled).

To	understand	this,	you	must	know	that	the	government	imposes	required	reports
on	publicly	traded	companies.	Every	company	must	file	an	annual	report	and	a
quarterly	report	that	contains	the	major	financial	information	for	the	stated	time
period.	 The	 reports	 that	 are	 delivered	 to	 the	 shareholders—typically	 in	 shiny
folders—are	usually	less	extensive	than	the	reports	filed	with	the	government.
For	this	reason,	you	may	prefer	to	read	the	reports	prepared	for	the	government.

•	 **10K	(Annual	Report):	** The	10K	is	the	name	denoted	to	the	annual	accounts
that	are	filed	for	all	major	business	activities	conducted	in	the	last	year.	Every
corporation	must	file	their	annual	accounts	within	sixty	to	ninety	days	after	the
fiscal	 year	 ends,	 depending	 on	 the	 size	 of	 the	 business.	 The	 annual	 reports
generally	cover	the	company’s	background	along	with	the	mission	and	vision	of


the	 organization.	 The	 annual	 accounts	 cover	 the	 hierarchical	 structure	 of	 the
organization,	 equity	 holdings,	 employees’	 interest,	 non-controlling	 interest,
subsidiaries,	 any	 legal	 issues	 faced	 by	 the	 company,	 the	 auditors,	 the	 control
procedures,	and	executives’	remuneration.

The	 three	 main	 financial	 statements	 are	 published	 with	 detailed	 notes	 on
accounts,	disclosures	and	any	events	that	might	have	occurred	after	the	balance
sheet	date.	Government	authorities	and	investors	are	likely	to	be	interested	in
annual	 accounts	 because	 they	 detail	 valuable	 information	 for	 analyzing	 the
company’s	present	and	future	growth	prospects.

•	 **10Q	(Quarterly	Report):	** The	quarterly	reports	produced	by	the	company	are
called	 10Q.	 These	 reports	 are	 a	 lot	 like	 the	 10K	 but	 only	 cover	 the	 previous
quarter—or	 last	 three	 months.	 Companies	 must	 file	 their	 quarterly	 accounts
within	forty	to	forty-five	days	from	the	end	of	the	fiscal	quarter,	depending	on
the	size	of	the	company.	The	quarterly	report	is	very	similar	to	the	annual	report,
only	it’s	not	as	encompassing.

•	 **8K	(Current	Report	Filing):** 	In	addition	to	the	annual	and	quarterly	report
requirements,	 publicly	 traded	 companies	 are	 also	 required	 to	 file	 a	 form	 that
reports	any	major	event	that	could	have	an	effect	on	the	company’s	financial
position;	for	example,	acquisitions	or	mergers	or	any	incident	that	significantly
harms	the	corporation’s	earning	capacity.	Major	events	could	also	include	forms
of	bankruptcy,	sale	of	a	subsidiary,	a	change	in	board	of	directors	or	a	change	in
the	reported	fiscal	year.	Major	events	such	as	these	are	likely	to	have	a	large
impact	on	a	corporation’s	earning	capacity	and	therefore	companies	are	required
to	file	a	form	no	later	than	four	days	from	the	date	of	the	event’s	occurrence.

So	what’s	the	point	of	discussing	the	10K,	10Q,	and	8K?	Well,	these	reports	are
important	because	they	hold	the	keys	to	solving	a	very	important	puzzle:	the
value	puzzle.	At	the	end	of	the	day,	our	ultimate	goal	as	stock	investors	is	to
know	 the	 value	 of	 each	 and	 every	 stock	 we	 buy.	 You	 wouldn’t	 buy	 a	 house
without	 knowing	 what	 it	 is	 worth,	 so	 why	 would	 you	 buy	 a	 business	 any
differently?	As	said	many	times	before,	buying	one	share	is	the	same	as	buying
the	whole	business.	So	if	you	are	buying	a	business,	you	need	to	know	its	value.
Reading	these	three	reports	will	unlock	the	door	to	a	company’s	true	value—or
intrinsic	value.


# Chapter	4	

## The	Principles	and	Rules	of	Value	Investing

Warren	Buffett	invests	according	to	four	simple	principles.

1.	Vigilant	leadership
2.	Long-term	prospects
3.	Stock	stability
4.	Buy	at	attractive	prices.

One	 of	 the	 greatest	 strengths	 of	 Warren	 Buffett	 is	 his	 ability	 to	 make	 things
simple.	 As	 you	 can	 see	 above,	 his	 principles	 are	 straightforward	 and	 easy	 to
remember.	As	you	navigate	your	way	through	this	book,	always	keep	these	four
principles	 at	 the	 forefront	 of	 your	 mind.	 Ensuring	 that	 all	 four	 are	 met	 at	 all
times	is	paramount	to	anything	else.	In	order	to	evaluate	these	four	principles,
Buffett	uncovers	data	and	qualitative	information	from	the	10K	and	10Q	reports.
As	 you	 already	 learned,	 these	 reports	 are	 required	 by	 the	 Security	 Exchange
Commission	(SEC)	and	are	available	to	anyone	in	the	public.


When	 Warren	 Buffett	 worked	 for	 Benjamin	 Graham,	 he	 was	 taught	 a	 very
mathematical	way	of	picking	stocks.	Although	this	approach	guided	Buffett’s
methodology	early	on,	he	slowly	deviated	from	Graham’s	teachings	in	a	couple


different	 ways.	 I	 have	 provided	 the	 framework	 for	 understanding	 those
deviations	along	with	subordinate	rules	for	each	of	the	principles.	Remember,
these	 nested	 rules	 are	 provided	 to	 help	 you	 gain	 a	 clearer	 picture	 of	 the
overarching	 four	 principles.	 The	 first	 three	 principles	 will	 have	 qualitative
features	and	some	numbers.	The	last	principle	is	based	on	quantitative	features
and	is	rooted	in	mathematics.	When	applying	all	four	principles	together,	you’ll
be	meshing	the	opinions	of	the	artist	with	the	facts	of	the	engineer.	Your	success
is	heavily	dependent	on	the	understanding	of	and	discovery	from	both	dynamics.

##### Principle	1—Vigilant	leaders

This	principle	has	four	subordinate	rules	that	will	help	you	determine	whether	a
company	is	managed	by	vigilant	leaders.	Although	numerous	other	factors	exist,
these	rules	can	be	used	as	a	starting	point	for	your	overall	assessment.

```
Rule	1—Low	debt
Rule	2—High	current	ratio
Rule	3—Strong	and	consistent	return	on	equity
Rule	4—Appropriate	management	incentives.
```
Imagine	that	you	are	taking	the	same	taxicab	to	work	every	day.	You	can	choose
between	a	driver	who	always	keeps	the	cab	within	the	speed	limit,	or	you	can
choose	a	driver	who	runs	red	lights	and	cuts	corners.	Which	kind	of	driver	would
you	choose?	I	personally	think	the	latter	would	be	exciting	and	thrilling,	but	I
would	rather	choose	the	first	one	on	a	permanent	basis.	I	would	like	the	driver
and	me	to	have	the	same	interest.	In	this	situation,	the	driver	would	be	my	agent
for	ensuring	safety.

Warren	 Buffett	 feels	 the	 same	 way	 about	 management.	 He	 knows	 that
management	is	an	agent	for	him	as	an	owner	(or	shareholder).	This	agent	should
serve	his	interest	at	all	times;	that	interest	is	to	make	the	most	of	his	invested
capital.	He	also	knows	that	vigilant	leaders	are	always	on	the	lookout	for	danger.

In	 reality,	 most	 management	 does	 not	 act	 in	 the	 interest	 of	 the	 owners.
Sometimes	they	focus	more	on	optimizing	their	own	pay	rather	than	optimizing
returns	to	the	shareholders.	In	other	cases,	management	may	have	the	intention
of	maximizing	the	returns	to	the	shareholders,	but	are	taking	high	risks	in	doing
so.	 Lastly,	 many	 managers	 simply	 want	 to	 grow	 their	 “empire”	 with	 the
shareholder’s	retained	earnings.	The	bigger	the	enterprise,	the	more	credibility
their	personality—or	at	least	they	think.	All	these	situations	create	less	value	for
you	as	a	shareholder.	By	the	end	of	this	principle,	we	will	discuss	some	rules


that	will	help	you	to	identify	and	avoid	such	managements.

**Rule	1—Low	debt**

Debt	is	like	stepping	on	the	accelerator	in	your	car.	If	the	road	ahead	is	smooth,
you	will	get	there	faster.	But	if	you	find	sharp	curves	or	bumps	in	the	road,	you
will	quickly	find	yourself	in	trouble.

Debt	in	investing	and	personal	finances	works	the	same	way;	for	example,	you
can	choose	to	finance	your	car	either	with	your	own	savings	or	through	debt.	It
may	be	tempting	to	borrow	money	for	a	car	as	this	enables	you	to	buy	a	more
expensive	model.	The	situation	is	even	more	pronounced	when	buying	a	house.
Most	people	would	never	be	able	to	buy	a	house	with	cash.	Debt	is	a	simple	and
effective	instrument	to	get	what	you	want	faster.	As	long	as	you	have	a	stable
income	that	can	pay	off	the	mortgage,	you	should	be	on	easy	street.

If	you	take	precautions,	there	is	nothing	wrong	with	accelerating	your	personal
finances.	The	problems	occur	if	you	hit	sharp	curves	and	bumps	in	the	road.
Though	we	do	not	like	to	think	about	it,	unhappy	circumstances	happen	now	and
then.	People	get	fired	and	sometimes	people	get	sick.	Many	homeowners	have
found	 themselves	 in	 that	 unfortunate	 situation,	 and	 ultimately	 discover	 how
important	it	is	to	have	minimal	debt	obligations.

The	situation	is	the	same	for	stock	investing.	When	you	buy	stock	in	a	company
that	 has	 a	 lot	 of	 debt,	 that	 company’s	 management	 has	 decided	 to	 accelerate
time.	They	needed	to	own	a	particular	asset	right	now	in	order	to	earn	more
business	 or	 remain	 competitive	 within	 their	 industry.	 When	 you	 buy	 yourself
into	a	company,	you	own	a	little	part	of	the	company’s	assets.	If	the	assets	are
financed	with	debt,	your	assets	are	bought	with	other	people’s	money.	On	the
one	hand,	this	allows	the	company	to	acquire	more	assets,	which	is	great	when
times	are	good.	On	the	other	hand,	it	also	increases	the	risk	of	the	company	if
demand	declines	or	competition	intensifies.	Think	of	debt	in	the	same	way	you
think	about	a	boat	traveling	on	a	particular	course.	Large	amounts	of	debt	would
look	like	a	cruise	liner	or	oil	vessel.	Small	amounts	of	debt	would	look	like	a
tiny	speedboat.	If	both	of	these	boats	were	traveling	in	the	same	direction	and
speed	and	suddenly	came	upon	shallow	land,	think	about	the	maneuverability
choices	that	both	captains	would	face	as	they	try	to	circumnavigate	the	obstacle.
The	cruise	liner	would	obviously	be	obtuse	and	slow	to	react.	Its	path	is	pretty
much	set,	with	very	little	room	to	adjust	its	course;	whereas	the	speedboat	can
quickly	change	course	and	continue	in	a	different	direction.	As	you	can	see,	we
are	 trying	 to	 find	 companies	 in	 the	 latter	 category.	 We	 want	 companies	 that


possess	flexibility	and	adaptability	for	the	course	ahead.	As	you	already	know,
business	 is	 highly	 competitive.	 The	 course	 ahead	 is	 pliable	 and	 constantly
changing.	Without	agility,	companies	lack	longevity.

Out	of	all	the	metrics	you’re	going	to	learn,	this	one	will	likely	be	one	of	the
most	important:	avoid	companies	with	large	amounts	of	debt.

In	investing,	one	of	the	tools	we	have	for	measuring	this	risk	is	called	the	debt-
to-equity	 (D/E)	 ratio.	 This	 ratio	 is	 really	 easy	 to	 understand	 and	 apply.	 For
starters,	let’s	calculate	your	personal	D/E	ratio	right	now.	This	exercise	is	very
similar	to	the	one	we	did	in	Chapter	3.

I	want	you	to	take	a	piece	of	paper	and	draw	a	line	down	the	middle,	splitting	the
paper	 into	 two	 halves.	 On	 the	 right	 side	 of	 the	 page,	 list	 all	 your	 debs—for
example:

House									$200,000	(be	sure	to	only	list	the	amount	remaining	on	your	loan)

Car													$10,000
Furniture					$2,000
etc...

Now	on	the	left	side	of	the	page,	list	all	the	things	you	own.	Be	sure	to	list	the
fair	 market	 value	 of	 each	 item;	 for	 example,	 your	 house	 might	 be	 worth
$300,000,	 but	 your	 TV	 might	 only	 be	 worth	 $50.	 You	 don’t	 need	 to	 be
extremely	thorough;	simply	list	the	big-ticket	items.

Once	you’ve	completed	both	lists,	add	up	the	value	at	the	bottom	of	the	left	and
right	columns.	On	the	left	side	of	the	page,	you	have	your	assets.	On	the	right
side	of	the	page,	you	have	your	liabilities.	In	order	to	determine	your	equity,	you
need	to	take	the	difference	between	these	two	numbers.

Let’s	say	you	had	$350,000	in	assets	(left	side)	and	$250,000	in	liabilities	(right
side).	The	difference	between	the	two	numbers	is	$100,000—that	would	be	your
equity.	This	is	what	you	would	have	left	if	you	sold	all	your	assets	and	paid	off
your	creditors.

Now,	to	determine	your	debt-to-equity	(D/E)	ratio,	we	will	simply	divide	your
liabilities	(right	side),	by	the	equity	number	you	just	determined	(i.e.,	$100,000).
In	the	example,	the	debt	to	equity	would	be	$250,000	 _$100,000.	This	gives	us	a
D_ E	of	2.5.

As	 you	 intuitively	 try	 to	 understand	 the	 importance	 of	 this	 number,	 try
substituting	 different	 liabilities	 into	 the	 debt	 variable	 to	 see	 how	 the	 ratio


changes;	for	example,	if	your	debt	was	very	low,	the	ratio	approaches	zero.	If	the
debt	 was	 really	 high,	 the	 ratio	 also	 moves	 higher.	 In	 the	 end,	 it’s	 simply	 a
multiple.	If	your	debt	is	$200,000	and	your	equity	is	$100,000,	we	can	quickly
say	that	you	have	twice	as	much	debt	as	equity.	This	is	reflected	in	the	D/E	ratio
as	a	2.0.	Warren	Buffett	likes	a	debt-to-equity	ratio	of	0.5	or	lower.	I	suggest	that
you	begin	investing	in	companies	with	low	debt.	As	you	become	more	familiar
with	 investing,	 you	 may	 like	 to	 assume	 more	 risk	 and	 allow	 companies	 with
slightly	more	debt	into	your	portfolio.	In	the	end,	you’re	the	person	assuming	the
risk	for	all	your	decisions,	so	choose	wisely.

Now,	 as	 with	 all	 ratios,	 this	 is	 just	 a	 rule	 of	 thumb.	 Some	 industries	 are
characterized	by	low	debt-to-equity	ratios;	while	banks,	with	a	core	product	of
debt,	 typically	 have	 higher	 ratios.	 You	 should	 therefore	 also	 consider	 the
industry	standard	for	normal	levels	of	debt.

It	is	important	to	understand	that	a	company	should	not	aim	to	have	no	debt	at
all.	That	is	seldom	a	goal	in	itself.	A	company’s	goal	should	be	the	flexibility	to
enter	good	projects	at	all	times	and	withstand	any	challenges	in	the	market.	This
is	generally	achieved	when	the	company	sustains	a	low	debt-to-equity	ratio	of
below	0.5.

**Rule	2—High	current	ratio**

Do	you	ever	find	yourself	running	low	on	cash	at	the	end	of	the	month?	If	you
do,	you	are	not	alone.	A	lot	of	people	have	well-paid	jobs	yet	still	struggle	to
make	 ends	 meet	 with	 their	 personal	 finances.	 The	 question	 is	 really	 not	 how
much	they	 _make_ ,	but	how	much	they	 _spend_.

Even	highly	profitable	companies	face	the	same	challenges.	Their	product	may
be	great	and	there	might	be	a	high	demand	for	it.	But	they	seem	to	be	short	of
cash	all	the	time.	The	problem	may	very	well	be	that	their	 _current	ratio_ 	is	too
low.

In	Chapter	3,	I	introduced	assets	and	liabilities	on	the	balance	sheet.	Assets	were
what	the	company	owned,	and	liabilities	were	what	the	company	owed.	When
we	talk	about	 _current_ 	asset,	it	is	something	that	we	expect	will	turn	into	cash
within	the	next	twelve	months.	It	could	be	inventory	that	we	expect	to	sell	when
the	next	order	is	placed.	A	current	liability,	on	the	other	hand,	is	something	that
we	need	to	pay	within	the	next	twelve	months.	It	could	be	raw	materials	that	we
have	received	from	a	supplier	but	haven’t	yet	paid	for.

When	 we	 compare	 our	 current	 assets	 and	 current	 liabilities,	 we	 are	 actually


looking	at	the	current	ratio.	The	formula	is	very	simple	and	looks	like	this:

```
Current	Ratio	=	Current	Assets	/	Current	Liabilities
```
Warren	 Buffett	 generally	 likes	 a	 current	 ratio	 above	 1.5.	 That	 means	 that	 he
wants	his	companies	to	receive	$1.5	every	time	a	debt	of	$1	must	be	paid	within
the	 next	 twelve	 months.	 The	 idea	 is	 straightforward:	 if	 a	 company	 always
receives	more	cash	than	it	pays	out,	the	company	can	meet	its	short-term	debt
obligations	at	any	time.

When	 analyzing	 the	 annual	 report,	 you	 will	 see	 that	 a	 high	 current	 ratio	 is
typically	a	sign	of	a	healthy	company.	If	the	ratio	is	below	1,	often	the	company
would	have	to	acquire	new	debt	to	pay	off	the	existing	debt	obligations.	That
only	postpones	and	accumulates	problems.

As	 such,	 it	 is	 also	 hard	 to	 put	 a	 strict	 rule	 on	 the	 current	 ratio.	 For	 most
companies,	a	current	ratio	of	between	1.5	and	2.5	is	desirable.	A	low	current
ratio	 may	 mean	 that	 the	 company	 has	 problems	 meeting	 their	 short-term
obligations,	while	a	higher	current	ratio	may	indicate	bad	money	management
due	to	an	inability	to	collect	payment	from	vendors.	Like	most	things,	a	balance
between	both	extremes	is	desirable.

**Rule	3—Strong	and	consistent	return	on	equity**

Are	you	good	at	first	impressions?	Do	you	smile	and	offer	a	firm	handshake
when	 you	 meet	 new	 people?	 A	 company’s	 first	 impression	 is	 their	 return	 on
equity	(ROE).	Just	as	a	first	impression	only	gives	you	a	quick	snapshot	of	who
the	other	person	is,	ROE	gives	you	a	snapshot	of	whether	you	should	invest	in
the	company	or	not.

In	Chapter	3,	I	introduced	the	net	income:	the	profit	that	a	company	makes	for	a
given	year.	I	also	introduced	the	equity	of	a	company,	which	is	simply	the	assets
subtracted	 by	 the	 liabilities.	 These	 two	 numbers	 are	 the	 basis	 for	 the	 simple
formula	for	ROE:

```
Return	on	Equity	=	Net	Income	/	Shareholders’	Equity.
```

Let’s	say	you	had	the	unique	opportunity	to	purchase	a	money	machine.	The
machine	 costs	 $100,000	 to	 own.	 The	 machine	 is	 capable	 of	 printing	 $10,000
worth	of	money	every	year.	This	means	an	investment	in	the	money	machine


would	 give	 you	 a	 return	 on	 equity	 of	 10%.	 The	 cost	 of	 the	 machine	 is	 your
equity	and	the	profit	from	the	printing	is	your	net	income.	It’s	truly	that	simple.

When	you	look	at	stock,	you	need	to	view	it	in	a	similar	light.

Now,	let’s	expand	on	our	example.	Let’s	say	we	have	another	opportunity	to	buy
a	second	money	machine.	This	machine	costs	$200,000	to	own.	Like	the	first
machine,	the	second	machine	also	prints	$10,000	worth	of	money	every	year.
Based	on	this	new	investment,	what	would	our	total	ROE	look	like	after	we	buy
the	second	machine?

Return	on	Equity	=	Net	Income	/	Shareholders’	Equity
Return	on	Equity	=	($10,000	+	$10,000)	/	($100,000	+	$200,000)
Return	on	Equity	=	$20,000	/	$300,000
ROE	=	6.7%

Now,	this	is	very	important.	We	saw	our	ROE	decrease	from	10%	to	6.7%	based
on	 our	 decision	 to	 buy	 the	 second	 money	 machine.	 Our	 decision	 made	 the
company’s	performance	less	efficient	compared	to	the	value	of	the	assets	we
already	possessed

To	illustrate	this	important	point,	let’s	go	back	to	the	spot	where	we	bought	the
second	money	machine.	Instead	of	buying	the	second	money	machine,	let’s	say
we	had	a	competitive	offer	to	buy	a	hotdog	stand	instead.	The	hotdog	stand	costs
$50,000	to	own	and	it	produces	a	$10,000	annual	profit.	Assuming	we	purchased
the	hotdog	stand	instead	of	the	second	money	machine,	what	would	our	ROE
be?

Return	on	Equity	=	Net	Income	/	Shareholders’	Equity
Return	on	Equity	=	($10,000	+	$10,000)	/	($100,000	+	$50,000)
Return	on	Equity	=	$20,000	/	$150,000
ROE	=	13.3%

As	we	closely	examine	the	two	different	paths,	we	can	see	how	the	first	option
(two	 money	 machines)	 produced	 a	 $20,000	 profit,	 and	 the	 second	 option	 (a
money	machine	and	a	hotdog	stand),	also	produced	a	$20,000	profit.	Although
the	profit	was	the	same,	the	second	choice	was	better	because	it	cost	us	less	to
produce	the	same	profit.	Our	choices	from	a	management	standpoint	were	more
efficient	with	the	second	path.	In	short,	we	produce	the	same	profit	with	half	the
equity.	This	is	a	great	thing	because	it	means	we	have	$150,000	less	money	tied
up.	This	extra	money	can	now	be	used	to	buy	more	assets;	for	example,	maybe
we	 could	 purchase	 another	 three	 hotdog	 stands	 with	 the	 $150,000	 difference.


Think	of	the	impact	that	would	have	on	the	ROE.

As	you	can	see,	the	ROE	is	extremely	important	because	it	demonstrates	the
effectiveness	of	management’s	ability	to	reinvest	your	profits	in	the	business.
Considering	most	companies	retain	most	of	the	profits	and	reinvest	the	money
for	 you,	 you’ll	 probably	 find	 the	 ROE	 one	 of	 the	 most	 important	 figures	 for
assessing	the	performance	of	your	stock.	It	should	come	as	no	surprise	that	ROE
is	Warren	Buffett’s	favorite	number.

In	general,	you	should	look	for	companies	that	have	had	a	consistent	ROE	of
above	8%	over	the	last	ten	years.	While	it	is	always	hard	to	give	more	than	a	rule
of	thumb	in	accounting,	a	ROE	above	8%	generally	tells	you	that	the	company	is
consistently	making	a	decent	profit	with	the	earnings	that	management	retains.

Unfortunately,	it	is	not	enough	just	to	check	whether	the	ROE	is	above	or	below
8%.	For	one	thing,	you	should	check	the	trend.	You	want	to	look	for	a	ROE	that
has	been	steady	or	even	increasing	over	the	last	eight	to	ten	years.	The	reason
this	is	so	important	is	when	a	company	is	making	a	profit,	it	will	generally	keep
all	or	some	of	the	capital	for	future	investments.	This	increases	the	equity,	which
is	in	the	denominator	of	the	formula	above.

On	 the	 other	 hand,	 it	 also	 means	 that	 if	 the	 company	 does	 not	 earn	 a
proportionally	 higher	 income	 when	 earnings	 are	 retained	 and	 reinvested,	 the
ROE	will	decline.	This	is	why	Warren	Buffett	places	so	much	emphasis	on	this
key	ratio.	It	captures	all	the	different	aspects	of	how	the	shareholders’	money	is
employed.	 It	 does	 not	 matter	 whether	 the	 money	 has	 been	 used	 on	 new
equipment	or	the	company	has	paid	too	much	for	acquiring	a	competitor.	The	net
income	must	follow	the	investment	level	to	maintain	a	steady	ROE.

That	said,	you	should	still	think	of	8%	as	a	general	benchmark.	A	satisfactory
ROE	differs	across	sectors.	In	the	insurance	industry,	a	steady	trend	of	around
8%	may	be	fine,	but	in	the	IT	industry,	it	might	not	be	adequate;	therefore,	after
you	have	checked	the	trend,	you	should	look	at	the	industry	for	a	comparison.

A	major	driver	behind	the	validity	of	ROE	is	the	company’s	financing	structure.
As	you	will	recall	from	Chapter	3,	a	company	can	be	financed	with	equity,	debt,
or	a	combination	of	the	two.	As	you	will	also	recall,	you	should	be	very	cautious
about	companies	with	a	debt-to-equity	ratio	of	higher	than	0.5.	If	you	fail	to	find
companies	with	minimal	debt,	you	might	find	yourself	in	a	ROE	mirage.


As	you	can	see	from	this	table,	you	should	look	at	the	value	and	trend	of	the
ROE	with	one	eye,	and	the	financing	structure	(or	D/E)	with	the	other.	So	you’re
probably	wondering	which	number	is	more	important.	The	answer	is	that	 _both_
are	equally	important.	Think	of	debt	as	your	metric	for	risk	and	ROE	as	your
metric	for	return.	Warren	Buffett’s	professor,	Ben	Graham,	consistently	said	to
never	be	attracted	to	a	high	return	while	compromising	security.	Or,	in	other
words,	manage	risk	first	(i.e.,	D/E),	then	consider	the	remaining	choices	based
on	yield	(i.e.,	ROE).	By	choosing	a	company	with	a	historical	D/E	of	below	0.5,
you	will	most	likely	end	up	with	companies	with	lower	ROE,	but	they	will	likely
be	more	sustainable	in	the	future.

As	you	have	seen,	and	will	continue	to	see	as	we	move	along,	accounting	ratios
such	as	ROE	are	subject	to	a	lot	of	distortion	when	it	comes	to	a	company’s	true
performance.	It	is	therefore	important	that	you	look	at	the	long-term	historical
trends.	 This	 will	 enable	 you	 to	 capture	 a	 much	 more	 credible	 view	 of	 the
company’s	performance.	Simply	looking	at	one	year’s	ROE	can	be	misleading.
The	key	for	you	is	to	understand	both	how	net	income	(or	profit)	and	equity	are
composed.	When	you	do	this,	ROE	is	a	great	measure	to	use.

**Rule	4—Appropriate	management	incentives**

What	do	sports	stars	and	stock	market	investors	have	in	common?	They	both
need	trustworthy	agents	in	order	to	be	successful.	Imagine	a	contract	for	a	sports
star	being	drawn	up	something	like	this:

_The	agent	receives	10%	of	the	salary	for	the	next	contract	he	mediates._

What	 do	 you	 expect	 will	 happen	 if	 the	 agent	 for	 the	 sports	 star	 can	 choose
between	 a	 high-paying	 or	 a	 low-paying	 contract?	 How	 much	 do	 you	 think	 it
matters	 to	 the	 agent	 that	 the	 sports	 star	 signs	 with	 a	 good	 team	 versus	 the
highest-paying	team?

You	 guessed	 it!	 If	 the	 sports	 star	 is	 not	 paying	 close	 attention	 to	 the	 agent’s
actions,	the	agent	may	act	in	his	own	self-interest	and	not	the	star’s.	In	finance
and	investing,	we	call	this	the	“principal	agent	problem.”	You,	as	an	investor,
are	the	principal,	and	you	want	the	management,	which	is	your	agent,	to	act	in


your	interest	when	running	the	business.

This	is	not	as	easy	as	it	sounds.	In	the	business	world,	the	agent	is	corporate
management.	The	sports	star	is	you,	the	owner.	The	corporate	management	is
working	for	you—plain	and	simple.	You	hired	them	to	run	your	business.	Now,
you	might	not	have	called	them	up	and	personally	put	them	into	their	job,	but	if
you	 had	 enough	 shares	 in	 the	 business,	 you	 might	 have	 that	 ability	 as	 the
chairman	 of	 the	 board.	 You	 see,	 if	 all	 the	 stockholders	 got	 together	 in	 an
auditorium,	they	would	holistically	represent	the	entire	ownership	of	any	given
business.	Since	this	is	nearly	impossible	to	do,	all	the	shareholders	elect	a	board
to	 represent	 them.	 This	 body	 of	 owners	 is	 called	 the	 board	 of	 directors.	 The
board	 of	 directors	 represents	 the	 interests	 and	 ideas	 of	 all	 the	 owners—or
shareholders.	 As	 you	 might	 expect,	 the	 chairman	 of	 the	 board	 is	 the	 top	 guy
leading	the	board.	If	you	don’t	like	a	particular	decision	the	company	has	made,
you	need	to	coordinate	with	the	members	of	the	board.	They	will,	in	turn,	voice
that	concern	to	the	management	that’s	been	hired	to	run	the	company—i.e.,	the
CEO	and	his	staff.	In	the	end,	never	forget	that	you’re	the	guy	at	the	top	of	the
pecking	order.	You’re	the	owner	of	the	business—the	principal.

As	 we	 look	 at	 this	 relationship,	 we	 can	 quickly	 see	 all	 the	 different	 interests
operating	 simultaneously.	 The	 management—or	 agent—obviously	 wants	 to
make	 money	 for	 the	 owners,	 but	 there	 are	 also	 other	 agendas	 at	 play;	 for
example,	 the	 CEO	 may	 want	 to	 expand	 “his”	 empire.	 This	 may	 result	 in	 his
decision	to	purchase	new	and	expensive	acquisitions	for	the	company.	This	may
create	very	little	value	for	the	owners	compared	to	the	capital	needed	to	grow	the
size	of	the	business.

What	should	you	do	about	this	as	an	investor?	How	can	you,	as	an	outsider,	see
what	is	going	on	inside	the	company?	Well,	sometimes	things	are	simply	outside
your	 purview.	 Other	 times,	 you	 might	 see	 disturbing	 trends	 in	 the	 financial
reports	or	news	articles.	In	the	end,	your	willingness	to	dig	for	information	will
likely	result	in	a	better	understanding	and	ability	to	understand	the	management
you	have	(indirectly)	hired.

A	 good	 place	 to	 start	 is	 by	 looking	 at	 how	 management	 is	 compensated.
Executives	 are	 seldom	 paid	 only	 a	 basic	 salary.	 Almost	 all	 executives	 are
compensated	by	a	base	salary	and	some	kind	of	bonus	package.	There	is	nothing
wrong	with	that,	as	long	as	the	compensation	really	does	measure	performance
and	incentivize	future	performance.	Sadly,	that	is	sometimes	not	the	case.


Traditionally,	compensation	packages	have	been	tied	to	the	performance	of	the
stock.	 For	 one	 thing,	 the	 stock	 price	 in	 the	 short	 run	 is	 almost	 completely
random.	 No	 one	 can	 predict	 what	 will	 happen	 to	 the	 stock	 price	 of	 a	 single
company	 within	 a	 few	 months.	 A	 bear	 market	 will	 punish	 even	 the	 best
managers,	and	a	bull	market	will	reward	even	the	worst.

Another,	 more	 severe,	 factor	 is	 that	 compensation	 based	 on	 stock	 price
performance	gives	management	wrong	incentives	to	act	truthfully	as	your	agent.
Management	can	actually	do	a	lot	to	increase	the	share	price	in	the	short	term,
which	is	not	in	your	favor	as	the	shareholder.	Yes,	that	is	true.	A	rising	stock
price	for	artificial	reasons	is	not	good	for	you	as	an	investor	(assuming	you	want
to	hold	your	investments	for	the	long	haul	like	Warren	Buffett).	Management
that	artificially	inflates	earnings	in	the	short	term	will	always	account	for	lower
(relative)	earnings	in	the	long	term—that’s	why	they	call	it	accounting.

If	 management	 is	 giving	 the	 incentive	 to	 solely	 focus	 on	 the	 share	 price,	 the
management	is	also	given	the	incentive	not	to	pay	out	dividends,	but	rather	to
retain	 all	 earnings	 even	 though	 there	 are	 no	 good	 projects	 to	 invest	 in.
Remember	that	a	company’s	equity	or	net	worth	drops	when	dividends	are	paid
out,	simply	because	there	is	less	cash	in	the	company.

As	mentioned	before,	another	thing	that	can	happen	when	management	is	given
inappropriate	incentives	is	that	it	starts	to	focus	on	the	psychology	of	the	market.
This	 means	 that	 they	 give	 statements	 and	 take	 decisions	 that	 often	 are
shortsighted	and	very	risky.	One	classical	example	is	to	set	unrealistic	goals	for
the	company	earnings.	The	market	rewards	ambitious	goals	in	the	short	run,	but
punishes	 them	 in	 the	 long	 run	 when	 it	 becomes	 clear	 that	 they	 become
unrealistic.

If	management	is	compensated	by	short-term	stock	price	increases,	it	will	have
an	incentive	to	do	whatever	it	can	to	boost	company	earnings.	If	the	stock	price
is	such	a	bad	measure	for	management	performance,	and	furthermore	gives	the
wrong	incentives	to	management,	why	are	so	many	management	compensation
packages	structured	in	this	shortsighted	way?

The	answer	is	actually	quite	simple:	the	stock	price	is	an	easy	and	transparent
measurement	 stick.	 The	 board	 that	 draws	 up	 the	 compensation	 package	 and
policies	is	often	comprised	of	shareholders	who	sometimes	have	a	short-term
horizon	themselves.

So,	how	should	one	ideally	measure	performance	and	what	should	you	look	for


when	validating	whether	a	company	has	trustworthy	management	that	will	work
as	your	agent?	The	first	thing	to	do	is	to	look	at	the	notes	in	the	annual	report.
The	accounting	rules	declare	that	management’s	salary	must	be	disclosed.	Some
companies	do	whatever	they	can	to	distort	any	information	about	this.	Needless
to	 say,	 you	 do	 not	 want	 to	 invest	 in	 these	 companies.	 On	 the	 other	 hand,
trustworthy	companies	and	management	teams	go	beyond	this	and	disclose	the
structure	of	the	compensation	plans.	You	want	a	company	that	discloses	how
much	 the	 base	 salary	 is	 and	 how	 much	 is	 variable,	 and	 which	 indicators	 the
management	is	measured	on.	Clearly	you	can’t	expect	a	company	to	disclose
that	manager	X	gets	$500,000	in	an	annual	base	salary	and	can	expect	to	receive
another	$300,000	if	he	manages	to	increase	sales	by	2,000	units	by	the	end	of
next	year.	That	specific	information	is,	and	should	be,	classified.

But	you	can	expect	a	trustworthy	management	with	high	integrity	to	disclose	a
management	 incentive	 structure	 that	 is	 coherent	 with	 your	 interests	 as	 a
shareholder.	That	means	that	managers	are	first	and	foremost	rewarded	based	on
performance	and	long-term	goals.	Managers	should	only	be	rewarded	for	what
they	 themselves	 can	 influence.	 For	 most	 managers,	 this	 would	 include	 their
specific	divisions.	Only	top	managers	can	be	expected	to	be	rewarded	for	the
performance	of	the	whole	organization.	You	should	also	look	for	rewards	for
long-term	goals.	Being	an	investor	and	owner	with	long-term	goals,	you	want
your	managers	to	be	in	line	with	you;	for	example,	you	should	look	for	long-
term	roadmaps	with	a	variety	of	objectives	to	be	obtained.

This	 is	 an	 important	 feature	 to	 understand	 about	 any	 organization.	 If	 you’re
looking	 to	 own	 a	 company	 for	 an	 extended	 period	 of	 time	 (which	 I	 highly
encourage),	then	you’ll	want	to	understand	the	standards	and	procedures	of	the
management	team.	You’ll	be	surprised	at	the	variance	from	one	company	to	the
next.

**Summing	up:	Vigilant	leaders**

```
A	debt-to-equity	ratio	of	below	0.5	is	preferred.	Debt	can	disrupt	even	the
best	businesses	because	it	limits	flexibility	and	agility.
To	maintain	flexibility,	you	should	also	make	sure	that	you	are	getting
more	cash	in	than	what	is	going	out.	This	can	be	measured	by	the
current	ratio,	which	should	be	at	least	1.5.
Vigilant	leaders	also	aim	to	make	a	decent	return	on	equity	(ROE).	Above
8%	consistently	over	a	period	of	ten	years	is	a	strong	indication	of	great
management.
```

Management	is	your	agent.	Their	one	and	only	task	is	to	give	you	the
most	value	for	your	invested	capital.	Make	sure	that	they	have	the
appropriate	monetary	incentives	to	do	so.


##### Principle	2—A	company	must	have	long-term	prospects

The	next	principal	has	two	subordinate	rules:

```
Rule	1—Persistent	products
Rule	2—Minimize	taxes
```
In	some	sense,	meteorologists,	investors	and	fortune	tellers	are	all	in	the	same
line	of	business:	they	all	try	to	predict	the	future.	The	average	stock	investor
aims	to	determine	how	the	demand	for	a	certain	product	will	develop.	Even	more
courageous,	investors,	for	example	in	high-tech	industries,	even	try	to	determine
the	demand	and	market	potential	for	innovative	products	they	can’t	even	buy
yet.	Value	investors	maybe	more	practical,	but	the	goal	is	the	same.	They	also
want	to	know	which	products	will	sell	in	the	future;	however,	they	put	more
emphasis	on	the	company’s	current	ability	to	earn.	Those	earnings	potentially
are	then	applied	to	future	years	to	determine	an	estimated	return	on	investment
through	the	long	haul.	The	reason	for	this	is	quite	simple:	value	investors	try	to
minimize	 taxes	 by	 owning	 outstanding	 businesses	 that	 remain	 stable	 over	 a
lifetime.

**Rule	1—Persistent	products**

Do	you	own	a	smartphone?	If	yes,	is	it	an	iPhone	or	an	Android?	The	answer	is
not	that	important,	but	the	question	is.	When	you	read	this,	perhaps	iPhones	and
Androids	are	no	longer	in	production.	Sometime	from	now,	people	may	even
wonder	what	a	smartphone	is—and	that	is	really	what	this	rule	is	all	about.

As	a	value	investor,	you	don’t	want	to	jump	in	and	out	of	the	market	all	the	time.
As	we	will	examine	in	the	next	rule,	taxes	and	broker	fees	make	this	short-term
thinking	too	expensive.	Instead,	you	want	to	invest	in	a	“persistent”	product,	a
product	that	will	not	change	in	the	next	thirty	years.	If	we	return	to	the	example
with	the	smartphones,	I	find	it	highly	unlikely	that	consumers	will	be	using	the
smartphones	 we	 know	 today	 in	 thirty	 years.	 That	 does	 not	 mean	 that	 Apple
cannot	continue	to	be	a	profitable	innovative	company	in	the	future;	it	simply
means	 that	 products	 like	 iPhones	 are	 more	 unpredictable	 compared	 to	 other
products.	 This	 opinion	 leaves	 me	 skeptical	 about	 highly	 technical	 stocks	 and
businesses	as	long-term	ventures

Ben	Graham	would	constantly	stress	to	his	students	that	speculation	was	reliant
on	a	change	in	future	results,	whereas	investing	was	not.	As	Apple	looks	to	their


future	profits,	therefore,	it	will	undoubtedly	be	reliant	on	their	ability	to	develop
a	new	technology	and	product—whereas	a	company	like	Coke	is	not	reliant	on
changing	their	future	product.	This	is	what	Graham	was	talking	about.

I	can’t	give	you	a	tool	to	determine	with	certainty	which	products	will	be	used
thirty	years	from	now.	But	what	I	can	do	is	give	you	Warren	Buffett’s	guideline
for	products	that	he	avoids	as	investment	objects.	It	is	simply	this:


```
“Will	the	Internet	change	the	way	we	use	the	product?”
```
Now,	 this	 guideline	 may	 be	 too	 simple	 to	 capture	 the	 future	 demands	 of	 all


products.	But	the	message	is	clear.	A	value	investor	is	interested	in	persistent
products	 that	 do	 not	 change	 due	 to	 technology.	 To	 show	 the	 power	 of	 this
guideline,	let	us	look	at	Coke.	People	have	been	drinking	Coke	for	more	than	a
century.	 We	 drank	 Coke	 before	 Apple	 invented	 iPhones	 and	 Intel	 produced
microchips.	 And	 I	 am	 sure	 that	 we	 will	 still	 drink	 Coke	 when	 iPhones	 are
outdated	 and	 microchips	 have	 been	 replaced	 with	 something	 even	 more
advanced.

Technology	has	never	changed	the	way	we	drink	Coke	or	soft	drinks,	by	and
large.	 People	 have	 always	 liked	 sugar	 and	 will	 continue	 to	 do	 so.	 That	 has
nothing	to	do	with	the	stock	market;	it	is	a	biological	fact.	Now,	there	might	be	a
variety	of	reasons	of	why	you	do	not	want	to	own	shares	in	Coke,	but	I	am	sure
that	soft	drinks	not	having	long-term	prospects	is	not	one	of	them.

When	 considering	 a	 new	 investment,	 you	 should	 aim	 to	 easily	 determine
whether	technology	will	significantly	change	the	demand	or	use	of	the	product.
If	it	can,	you	should	maybe	consider	an	alternate	investment	object—or	assume
the	 risks	 associated	 with	 such	 a	 venture	 and	 be	 prepared	 for	 its
consequences/rewards.

For	 instance,	 people	 have	 always	 had	 the	 need	 for	 communicating	 with	 each
other.	We	used	to	write	letters,	and	before	that	we	used	telegraphs.	There	is	no
reason	to	believe	that	there	will	be	less	communication	in	the	future;	however,
whether	this	communication	will	continue	on	one	of	Apple’s	products	is	hard	to
predict.	Value	investing	is	about	finding	persistent	and	predictable	products	with
long-term	prospects.	A	product	that	has	been	here	for	thirty	years	and	can	be
expected	to	be	here	for	at	least	another	thirty	years	is	a	good	place	to	start	your
search	for	valuable	companies.

**Rule	2—Minimize	taxes**

Do	you	know	the	formula	for	getting	rich?	It	is	not	a	secret	formula	known	only
to	the	wealthy.	One	side	of	the	equation	is	to	maximize	your	income.	The	more
money	you	make,	the	more	money	you	can	set	aside	for	future	investment	and
consumption.	We	often	think	a	lot	about	this	side	of	the	equation.	But	the	other
side	of	the	equation	is	just	as	important—if	not	more	so:	you	should	minimize
your	expenses.

I	am	not	talking	about	remembering	to	turn	off	the	lights	when	leaving	your
home,	or	taking	the	bus	instead	of	the	car.	I	am	talking	about	one	of	your	biggest
expenses	 in	 personal	 finances:	 taxes.	 Few	 people	 notice	 it	 because	 they	 only


look	 at	 the	 bottom	 of	 their	 pay	 slip,	 but	 taxes	 are	 a	 major	 expense	 in	 every
household.

In	investing,	taxes	are	equally	a	problem	for	profit	maximization.	If	you	are	like
me,	your	goal	with	value	investing	is	to	establish	a	new	source	of	income	outside
your	daily	job.	By	minimizing	your	tax,	you	indirectly	improve	your	return	on
investments.	Luckily,	minimizing	taxes	on	capital	gains	is	very	easy	to	do.

The	 following	 table	 shows	 the	 current	 American	 tax	 bracket	 for	 2014.	 Don’t
worry	if	you	do	not	live	in	America;	this	example	is	applicable	for	any	investor.
In	most	countries,	the	tax	system	is	similar	to	that	in	America:	it	rewards	value
investors	who	are	in	the	game	for	the	long	haul,	and	punishes	day	traders	who
aren’t	creating	value	but	are	simply	trying	to	make	a	quick	buck.

More	than	$406,750 39.6% 20%
```
Short-term	capital	gain	<	1	year	of	holding

Your	tax	rate	on	capital	gains	is	determined	by	your	ordinary	income	tax	rate;
for	example,	if	your	ordinary	income	is	$100,000	you	would	still	pay	28%	in	tax
if	you	make	a	short-term	capital	gain,	but	if	you	hold	on	to	the	stock	for	more
than	a	year,	you	would	only	pay	15%	tax	on	the	gain.	The	tax	system	favors	the
value	 investor	 over	 the	 average	 investor.	 If	 you	 ever	 wondered	 why	 Warren
Buffett’s	holding	period	is	forever,	this	is	why.

In	addition	to	a	lower	tax	rate,	you	must	also	realize	that	this	tax	is	only	paid	if
you	decide	to	sell	the	stock;	for	example,	if	you	hold	on	to	a	stock	for	twenty
years,	the	value	of	the	stock	can	compound	with	no	friction	of	personal	taxes
each	 year.	 You	 only	 pay	 this	 tax	 when	 you	 decide	 to	 sell	 the	 position	 after
twenty	years.	On	the	other	hand,	if	you	owned	a	bunch	of	different	stocks	within
the	same	twenty	years	and	always	sold	your	position	within	a	year’s	timeframe,


you	would	pay	the	high	tax	rate	every	single	year.

Let	me	illustrate	the	tax	effect	in	this	generic	example.

This	table	shows	the	growth	of	a	$50,000	investment	and	how	it	compounded
over	a	20-year	period.	At	the	end	of	this	period,	the	investor	pays	tax	only	once
—at	15%	on	the	growth.	The	investment	turns	into	$293,419	after	taxes.	The


assumption	is	the	principal	grew	at	a	steady	10%	increase	every	year.

In	this	table,	you	will	see	how	a	day	trader	in	the	28	%	tax	bracket	experiences
10%	annual	growth.	Since	he	is	trading	between	different	stocks,	he	will	pay	the
short-term	capital	gains	rate	every	year.	What	is	interesting	about	this	example	is
that	the	return	he	got	from	his	stocks	was	exactly	the	same	as	that	of	the	value
investor	(10%	per	year),	but	he	ends	up	with	much	less	due	to	the	taxes	paid.	If
we	compare	the	value	investor’s	results	with	those	of	the	day	trader,	they	look
like	this:


What	is	really	interesting	is	that	the	taxes	paid	are	not	that	different.	The	day
trader	has	only	paid	$15,707	more	in	tax	than	the	value	investor.	Still,	the	value
investor	ends	up	with	$92,572	more	than	the	day	trader.	As	you	can	see,	the
friction	of	an	annual	tax	expense	diminishes	the	compounding	effect.	As	a	result,
the	day	trader	is	consistently	paying	higher	taxes	of	a	smaller	amount—and	he’s
doing	a	lot	more	work	too.

This	example	really	shows	the	power	behind	Warren	Buffett’s	second	principle
of	investing.	By	investing	in	companies	with	long-term	prospects,	you	maintain
as	much	return	on	your	investment	as	possible,	by	minimizing	your	taxes.

**Summing	up:	A	company	must	have	long-term	perspectives**

```
Persistent	demand	for	the	products	or	services	is	a	crucial	characteristic	of
Warren	Buffett’s	second	principle.	Warren	Buffett’s	favorable	holding
period	is	 forever.
Tax	is	one	of	your	biggest	expenses	as	an	investor.	Let	your	investment
compound	and	grow	for	a	long	period	of	time	before	the	government
gets	their	share.	You’ll	be	rewarded	by	higher	relative	returns	and	lower
tax	rates.
```

##### Principle	3—A	company	must	be	stable	and	understandable

```
Rule	1—Stable	book	value	growth	from	the	owner’s	earnings
Rule	2—Sustainable	competitive	advantage	(moat)
```
If	you	think	that	Warren	Buffett	has	become	rich	by	finding	new	and	exciting
companies	with	products	that	the	world	has	never	seen,	you	only	need	to	take	a
look	at	his	portfolio	to	be	proven	wrong.

According	to	Warren	Buffett,	one	key	element	in	his	strategy	is	to	only	invest	in
companies	that	are	stable	and	understandable.	If	a	company	is	not	stable,	Buffett
cannot	reduce	his	risk	and	value	the	company	properly.	If	he	cannot	understand
the	company,	he	cannot	determine	whether	the	business	is	profitable	now	and
will	be	in	the	future.	In	fact,	investing	in	stable	companies	might	have	been	the
most	 important	 rule	 that	 Benjamin	 Graham	 taught	 Warren	 Buffett	 for
minimizing	risk	in	an	investment.

In	addition	to	finding	a	stable	business,	Warren	Buffett	also	talks	about	the	idea
of	staying	within	your	“circle	of	competences.”	Buffett	is	well	aware	that	there
are	 a	 lot	 of	 businesses	 in	 this	 world	 that	 he	 simply	 doesn’t	 understand.	 He
therefore	 chooses	 to	 stay	 within	 his	 circle	 of	 competences,	 which	 basically
means	only	doing	what	he	is	good	at.	In	this	sense,	it	is	less	important	whether
you	know	ten	or	a	thousand	businesses	and	sectors,	as	long	as	you	stick	with
what	you	know.	As	Buffett	puts	it:	“At	the	Olympics,	if	you	run	the	hundred
meters	well,	you	don’t	have	to	do	the	shot-put.”

Ultimately,	 you	 also	 need	 to	 understand	 the	 company	 because	 you	 would
otherwise	not	know	when	to	sell	or	buy	the	stock	again.	If	you	understand	the
company,	 you	 will	 understand	 the	 fundamentals	 that	 drive	 the	 profit,	 thereby
also	understanding	the	company’s	competitive	edge.

**Rule	1—Stable	book	value	growth	from	the	owner’s	earnings**

I	 love	 to	 read	 about	 this	 year’s	 “must	 have”	 gadget.	 I	 personally	 think	 it	 is
amazing	what	new	innovative	companies	emerge	each	year.	The	funny	thing	is,	I
usually	don’t	know	about	the	company	before	reading	the	article,	and	I	seldom
hear	about	them	ever	again.	But	new	and	exciting	companies	are	generally	not
stable,	 and	 stability	 is	 exactly	 what	 we	 should	 be	 looking	 for	 if	 we	 want	 to
follow	Buffett’s	simple	principles.

So	 how	 do	 we	 measure	 the	 stability	 of	 a	 stock?	 In	 the	 most	 simple	 form,	 I


suggest	that	you	look	at	the	stability	and	growth	of	book	value	and	earnings	per
share.	This	is	not	only	because	Warren	Buffett	says	that	the	changes	in	book
value	are	similar	to	the	changes	in	intrinsic	value,	but	because	it	explains	two
very	important	aspects	of	investing.	It	shows	that	book	value	growth	comes	from
earnings,	and	it	explains	the	importance	of	 _owner’s	earnings._

Let’s	first	look	at	a	generic	example	of	book	value	growth	from	earnings.	As	you
probably	 remember,	 the	 equity	 (or	 book	 value)	 of	 a	 company	 is	 really	 the
shareholders’	money.	A	company	should	always	aim	to	increase	the	wealth	of	its
shareholders,	which	means	that	either	the	company’s	assets	must	increase	or	its
liabilities	must	decrease.	These	changes	must	come	from	earnings.

Let’s	 assume	 that	 you	 just	 started	 a	 sandwich	 shop	 and	 you	 financed	 it	 with
$1,000	of	your	own	money	and	$500	from	the	bank.	Your	balance	sheet	would
look	like	this	at	the	start	of	the	year:

```
Assets 1,500 Equity 1,000
Liabilities 500
```
```
Assets 1,500
-Liabilities 500
Equity 1,000
```
You	are	making	great	sandwiches	and	by	the	end	of	the	year,	you	have	achieved
a	$100	profit.	This	$100	can	either	be	used	to	buy	new	assets,	such	as	a	new
refrigerator,	or	you	can	pay	off	your	debt	to	the	bank.	Let’s	see	what	happens	in
each	of	these	situations.	First,	you	employ	the	$100	as	a	new	asset:

```
Assets 1,600 Equity 1,100
Liabilities 500
```
```
Assets 1,600
-Liabilities 500
Equity 1,100
```

As	you	can	see	in	the	example	above,	the	$100	is	added	to	the	assets,	which	in
turn	increases	the	owners’	wealth,	which	is	reflected	in	the	equity.	Instead	of
purchasing	a	new	asset,	you	could	also	pay	off	the	$500	of	liabilities.	Let’s	say
you	would	rather	use	the	$100	to	pay	back	some	of	the	loan.	In	that	case,	your
balance	would	look	like	this:

```
Assets 1,500 Equity 1,100
Liabilities 400
```
```
Assets 1,500
-Liabilities 400
Equity 1,100
```
What	 we	 see	 from	 this	 example	 is	 that	 if	 we	 need	 to	 increase	 equity,	 the
company	 needs	 to	 produce	 earnings.	 Whether	 we	 use	 those	 earnings	 to	 buy
assets	such	as	a	refrigerator	or	pay	off	some	of	our	bank	loan,	it	will	be	equally
reflected	in	the	equity.

Finally,	let’s	see	an	example	of	how	the	payment	of	a	dividend	will	impact	the
owner’s	earnings.	A	dividend	is	a	portion	of	the	income	that	is	returned	to	the
owners	in	the	form	of	a	cash	payment.	Say	that	$25	of	the	$100	is	paid	out	as	a
dividend.	The	remaining	$75	remains	in	the	company’s	cash	accounts.	When
you	look	at	your	balance	sheet,	it	looks	like	this:

```
Assets 1,575 Equity 1,075
Liabilities 500
```
```
Assets 1,575
-Liabilities 500
Equity 1,075
```
The	example	above	demonstrates	the	application	of	owner’s	earnings.	Here,	$25
of	the	original	$100	goes	back	to	the	owner	in	the	form	of	a	cash	dividend.	The
remaining	$75	is	retained	in	the	company	for	future	growth	and	 _may_ 	become
owner’s	 earnings	 if	 it	 is	 deployed	 wisely.	 If	 you’re	 wondering	 what	 would
constitute	 a	 wise	 use	 of	 the	 retained	 earnings	 (the	 $75),	 simply	 look	 at	 the


company’s	historical	Return	on	Equity	(ROE).	That	will	give	you	a	good	idea	of
what	management	has	previously	done	with	the	money	they	have	retained.	It	is
extremely	important	to	find	a	company	that	demonstrates	a	consistent	earnings
capacity,	book	value	growth,	and	a	stable	and	respectable	ROE	over	numerous
years,	not	just	a	few.

So	let’s	return	to	the	original	sandwich	shop	scenario	and	see	whether	it	fulfills
Warren	Buffett’s	stability	rule.

```
Assets 1,500 Equity 1,000
Liabilities 500
```
```
Assets 1,500
-Liabilities 500
Equity 1,000
```
In	 this	 example,	 I	 have	 decided	 to	 split	 your	 sandwich	 shop	 into	 100	 shares
resulting	in	a	book	value	of	$10	($1,000/100)	per	share.	Remember,	book	value
is	 nothing	 more	 than	 equity	 per	 share.	 I	 have	 assumed	 that	 the	 company	 has
reinvested	the	retained	earnings	appropriately,	therefore	the	profits	continue	to
grow.	This	profit	growth	(or	earnings	growth)	is	reflected	in	a	steady	earnings
per	share	(EPS)	increase	over	time.	This	is	extremely	important:	If	the	company
retains	 earnings	 (reflected	 in	 book	 value	 growth),	 there	 should	 be	 a
corresponding	growth	in	future	earnings	(reflected	in	EPS	growth).

A	quick	and	easy	way	to	check	if	this	is	happening	is	to	ensure	that	the	return	on
equity	(ROE)	remains	constant	or	even	grows.	If	you	look	at	the	graph	below,
you’ll	notice	that	the	ROE	remains	constant	as	the	book	value	and	EPS	grow
proportionally.	As	you	recall,	the	ROE	is	what	the	owners	get	in	return	for	the
capital	that’s	retained	in	the	company.	As	investors,	we	really	want	this	number
to	be	consistent	and	stable.



If	we	plot	this	into	a	graph,	it	will	look	like	this:

As	you	can	see,	you	can	almost	fit	a	perfect	trend	line	through	the	ten	years	for
the	figures.	This	is	really	what	value	investors	are	looking	for.	Because	the	stock
is	stable,	the	value	investor	has	a	better	chance	at	predicting	future	earnings	and
performance	by	applying	a	trend	line.

Of	course,	history	does	not	always	repeat	itself.	Warren	Buffett	has	said,	“If	past


history	is	all	there	was	to	the	game,	the	richest	people	would	be	librarians.”	But,
Warren	Buffett	acknowledges	that	a	stable	and	understandable	company	is	the
basis	for	minimizing	risk	and	setting	expectations	for	potential	performance.	In
an	effort	to	help	you	determine	the	stability	of	a	company,	we	have	created	a
graphing	tool	at	the	BuffettsBooks.com	website	that	allows	you	to	plot	ten	years’
worth	 of	 data	 for	 any	 given	 company.	 The	 graphing	 tool	 has	 6	 inputs:	 EPS,
ROE,	 Dividend	 Rate,	 Book	 Value,	 Debt/Equity,	 and	 the	 Current	 Ratio.	 The
specific	Web	address	for	accessing	the	tool	is:

[http://www.buffettsbooks.com/intelligent-investor/stocks/stock-stability.html](http://www.buffettsbooks.com/intelligent-investor/stocks/stock-stability.html)

When	 you	 arrive	 at	 the	 address,	 you’ll	 see	 there	 are	 two	 videos	 to	 help	 you
understand	how	to	use	the	graphing	tool.

Although	other	metrics	are	also	important	in	determining	whether	a	company	is
stable	and	predictable,	these	criteria	are	definitely	a	great	starting	point.	When
the	numbers	check	out	and	stability	metrics	are	fulfilled,	we	can	go	on	to	the
qualitative	approach.	Warren	Buffett	says,	“Valuing	a	business	is	part	art	and
part	science.”

We	will	now	turn	to	the	art	of	investing.

**Rule	2—Sustainable	competitive	advantage	(moat)**

When	Warren	Buffett	describes	the	idea	of	having	a	competitive	advantage	in
business,	he	likens	it	to	a	moat	around	a	castle.	Enemy	businesses	will	try	to
conquer	 your	 castle	 if	 you	 don’t	 have	 a	 moat.	 Preferably,	 he	 would	 like	 an
honest	 and	 hardworking	 duke	 to	 govern	 that	 castle—but	 all	 wonderful
businesses	have	moats.

While	moats	can	be	identified,	they	are	different	from	one	company	to	another.
A	company	like	Coca-Cola	has	a	great	moat	due	to	its	enormous	brand	value,
whereas	a	company	like	Wal-Mart	has	a	wide	moat	due	to	its	cost	structure.
Wal-Mart	buys	on	such	large	volume	that	it	can	buy	products	from	its	suppliers
at	a	cheaper	price	than	its	competitors.

If	the	moat	is	wide	enough,	it	is	hard—if	not	impossible—to	conquer	the	castle.
The	idea	is	simple:	the	sustainable	competitive	advantage	cannot	be	duplicated
by	competitors;	hence	the	business	will	keep	pouring	money	into	the	owners’
pockets.	If	I	sold	strawberries	from	a	stand,	you	could	set	up	a	similar	business
right	next	to	mine.	But	can	you	duplicate	Coca-Cola’s	brand,	or	Wal-Mart’s	cost
structure?	That	is	the	 _moat_.


So	 far,	 we	 have	 provided	 a	 variety	 of	 different	 quantifiable	 guidelines	 for
Warren	Buffett’s	principles	to	investing.	With	competitive	advantage,	this	is	not
so	 simple.	 You	 can’t	 find	 anywhere	 in	 the	 financial	 reports	 that	 a	 moat	 has
increased	from	8	to	10.	Such	a	metric	does	not	exist.	I	urge	you	to	never	buy	a
company	that	does	not	have	moat.	We	know	that	Warren	Buffett’s	second	rule	is
only	to	invest	in	long-term	prospects,	and	that	goes	hand	in	hand	with	finding	a
company	that	has	a	unique	competitive	advantage.	A	company	with	no	moat	will
be	outmatched	over	time	by	competitors,	no	matter	how	persistent	the	demand	is
for	its	products	and	services.

Determining	 a	 company’s	 moat	 is	 a	 qualitative	 process.	 The	 things	 that	 can
create	moats	in	one	industry	are	not	the	same	as	those	in	another	industry.	In
general,	I	would	say	that	if	you	cannot	see	a	company’s	moat,	there	are	two
reasons:	 the	 first	 is	 because	 it	 is	 not	 there;	 the	 second	 is	 that	 you	 do	 not
sufficiently	understand	the	company.	In	either	case,	you’ll	assume	a	lot	of	risk	if
you	invest	in	the	company	and	you	don’t	understand	its	competitive	advantage.
Between	 all	 the	 very	 specific	 moats	 in	 industries,	 I	 would	 emphasize	 the
following	three:

1.	Intangible	assets	such	as	brands	and	patents	are	one	type	of	moat.	Disney	is	an
example.	It	is	a	strong	brand	and	almost	everyone	in	the	world	recognizes	it.	To
demonstrate	this	idea,	Warren	Buffett	uses	the	example	of	a	mom	picking	up	a
movie	for	her	kids	on	her	way	home	from	work.	The	Disney	movie	is	$1	more
expensive	than	another	choice,	and	she	does	not	know	the	quality	of	either	of	the
movies.	Which	movie	would	she	choose?	The	Disney	movie	of	course!	People
identify	good	things	happening	with	Disney,	and	that	is	a	hard	moat	to	compete
against.
2.	Low	cost	is	another	type	of	moat.	Every	retailer	in	the	world	buys	goods	from
suppliers,	 and	 since	 the	 difference	 between	 cost	 and	 price	 is	 the	 profit,	 the
retailer	will	do	whatever	possible	to	buy	from	its	suppliers	at	the	lowest	cost.
Wal-Mart	has	a	wide	moat	around	its	business,	as	it	can	buy	at	quantities	and
prices	that	competitors	can’t	match.
3.	 High	 switching	 costs—or	 “stickiness”	 as	 Warren	 Buffett	 refers	 to	 it—is
another	type	of	moat.	If	there	is	one	company	with	high	switching	costs,	it	must
be	 Microsoft	 Windows.	 It	 is	 very	 hard	 to	 find	 computers	 that	 do	 not	 run	 on
Microsoft	Windows.	It	is	not	about	whether	there	is	any	better	operating	system
out	there.	Most	people	will	not	bother	with	the	hassle	of	changing,	because	they
do	not	want	to	re-learn	the	new	system.	Anyone	who	invents	a	new	system	will


have	a	tough	time	conquering	the	operating	system’s	market.

**Summing	up:	A	company	must	be	stable	and	understandable**

```
Finding	a	company	that	is	stable	and	understandable	is	paramount
because	it	reduces	risk.	In	the	end,	we	are	trying	to	determine	the	value
of	a	company	(or	stock).	This	can	only	be	accomplished	with	minimal
risk	if	we	can	reasonably	assess	and	predict	the	direction	of	the
company’s	future	earnings.
By	only	investing	in	companies	with	a	durable	competitive	advantage,
you	also	reduce	long-term	risks.	A	moat	can	come	in	the	form	of
intangibles,	low-cost	structures,	and	high	switching	costs	(or
stickiness).
```

##### Principle	4—Buy	at	attractive	prices

Every	kid	has	heard	the	old	saying	about	a	bird	in	the	hand	being	worth	two
birds	in	the	bush.	Warren	Buffett	likes	to	use	this	same	analogy	when	he	talks
about	investing.	Because	what	 _is_ 	investing,	really?	Isn’t	it	just	the	decision	about
whether	one	dollar	today	is	better	than	two	dollars	tomorrow?

Warren	 Buffett	 has	 never	 publicly	 disclosed	 a	 formula	 or	 model	 for	 buying
undervalued	 stocks.	 Still,	 Warren	 Buffett	 is	 a	 generous	 man,	 and	 through	 his
shareholders’	 letters	 he	 has	 revealed	 the	 fundamentals	 of	 his	 valuation
techniques.

In	 an	 effort	 to	 keep	 things	 as	 simple	 as	 possible,	 I	 have	 developed	 multiple
calculators	 that	 incorporate	 the	 ideas	 from	 Buffett’s	 numerous	 letters	 and
articles.	These	calculators	will	help	you	determine	the	intrinsic	value	of	stocks
that	fulfill	the	first	three	principles.

Before	 we	 discuss	 the	 calculations,	 I	 will	 first	 present	 other	 factors	 that	 also
apply	to	finding	stocks	at	attractive	prices.

```
Rule	1—Keep	a	wide	margin	of	safety	to	the	intrinsic	value
Rule	2—Low	price-earnings	ratio
Rule	3—Low	price-to-book	ratio
Rule	4—Set	a	safe	discount	rate
Rule	5—Buy	undervalued	stocks—Determining	intrinsic	value
Rule	6—The	right	time	to	sell	your	stocks
```
**Rule	1	-	Keep	a	wide	margin	of	safety	to	the	intrinsic	value**

How	 would	 you	 go	 about	 building	 a	 bridge	 if	 you	 knew	 that	 10,000-pound
trucks	would	be	driving	over	that	bridge	every	day?	Would	you	build	the	bridge
to	withstand	the	pressure	of	10,001	pounds?	No;	you	would	probably	build	the
bridge	to	withstand	at	least	15,000	pounds,	and	preferably	a	lot	more.

Margin	of	safety	was	first	introduced	by	Warren	Buffett’s	professor	and	mentor
Benjamin	 Graham.	 It	 is	 a	 very	 simple,	 yet	 powerful,	 concept	 for	 any	 value
investor	to	understand.	If	you	evaluate	a	stock	to	be	worth	$100,	it	makes	very
little	sense	to	buy	it	at	$99.	For	one	thing,	you	may	be	completely	wrong	in	your
assessment	of	the	stock’s	value	and	a	margin	of	$1	leaves	very	little	room	for
error.	On	top	of	the	risk	you	assume,	it	will	be	equally	hard	to	make	an	adequate
profit	from	the	stock.	Sure,	the	stock	may	perform	8-10%	a	year	on	average,	but
you	miss	out	on	the	extra	return	you	gain	from	buying	an	undervalued	stock	as	it


returns	to	its	fair	value.

When	you	hear	the	term	“margin	of	safety,”	you	might	think	that	you	have	read
something	along	these	lines	earlier	in	this	book.	You	are	correct!	In	the	first
chapter	I	introduced	you	to	Mr.	Market.	He	was	our	highly	unstable	friend	with
huge	mood	swings	that	showed	up	at	our	door	every	day	with	new	prices	to	buy
and	 sell	 stocks.	 He	 is	 the	 reason	 the	 stock	 price	 does	 not	 always	 follow	 the
company’s	 _intrinsic	value_ .	Remember	that	the	intrinsic	value	is	the	company’s
real	or	fair	value,	regardless	of	what	the	stock	price	is.	The	margin	of	safety	is
the	difference	between	the	share	price	and	the	intrinsic	value.

Just	as	with	the	example	of	the	bridge,	you	will	want	to	have	as	wide	a	margin	of
safety	 as	 possible.	 How	 much	 you	 want	 is	 based	 on	 your	 desires:	 if	 you
understand	 the	 business	 and	 the	 risks	 associated	 with	 ownership,	 you	 will
definitely	be	able	to	have	a	narrower	margin	of	safety.	It	is	hard	to	put	an	exact
number	 on	 the	 margin	 of	 safety,	 as	 the	 decision	 to	 buy	 a	 stock	 is	 always
dependent	on	the	other	alternative	choices.	If	a	margin	of	safety	is	30%	on	one
stock,	 it	 may	 look	 tempting,	 but	 if	 you	 have	 the	 option	 to	 buy	 another	 great
business	(of	equal	risk)	with	a	50%	discount,	you	would	go	for	that	one	instead.

**Rule	2—Low	price-earnings	ratio**

One	of	the	most	basic	valuation	techniques	is	the	price-earnings	ratio	(P/E).	P/E
is	so	popular	with	analysts	because	it	gives	a	quick	answer	to	the	one	question
that	all	investors	keep	asking:	“How	big	a	return	can	I	get	from	my	investment
right	now?”

Imagine	that	you	have	the	opportunity	to	buy	a	juice	stand	at	the	price	of	$1,000.
Naturally,	you	would	ask	the	current	owner	how	much	profit	he	made	last	year.


Say	that	he	made	$100.	Now	you	have	the	input	to	calculate	the	P/E:

```
Market	Price	for	the	company	 Net	Income	=	P E
$1,000	 $100	=	10	=	P E
```
Since	this	number	is	a	ratio,	we	must	always	remember	that	the	denominator	(or
number	on	the	bottom	of	the	fraction)	is	always	1;	therefore,	a	P/E	ratio	of	10	is
actually	a	10/1	ratio.	This	means	that	every	ten	dollars	of	price	towards	the	stock
should	 give	 you	 one	 dollar	 of	 earnings	 (for	 one	 year).	 So	 if	 we	 want	 to
understand	this	relationship	as	a	percentage,	we	need	to	look	at	the	inverse	of	it
—or	in	other	words,	the	E/P	ratio.	By	taking	the	inverse	of	the	P/E,	we	get	a
percentage	yield;	for	example,	the	previous	situation	had	a	P/E	of	10.	Therefore
1/10	=	10%.	That’s	the	annual	yield.	Let’s	try	it	again	but	with	a	different	P/E
ratio.	If	you	negotiated	a	lower	price	of	$800	for	the	juice	stand	and	the	business
still	produced	the	same	earnings,	you	would	have	a	P/E	of:	$800/$100	=	8.	Or	a
return	of	1/8	=	12.5%.	As	you	can	see,	a	low	P/E	is	preferable	to	a	high	P/E.

When	you	hear	that	a	company	has	a	P/E	of	10,	this	is	what	the	commotion	is
about.	You	will	often	see	that	the	P/E	is	constantly	changing	throughout	a	year.
That	is	very	natural.	Remember	that	the	share	price	changes	every	day,	which
means	the	P/E	will	change	every	day.	When	you	read	financial	news,	it	does	not
cover	juice	stands,	but	rather	individual	shares.	Don’t	be	confused	by	this;	the
mechanism	is	the	same	whether	the	price	of	the	company	is	divided	into	single
shares	or	you’re	valuing	the	entire	company.	So	let’s	take	this	simple	scenario
and	add	more	variables.	We	said	the	juice	stand	was	valued	at	$1,000	for	the
entire	business.	Now,	let’s	divide	the	business	into	a	hundred	equal	pieces—or
shares,	if	you	will.	When	we	divide	the	business	into	a	hundred	shares,	each
share	is	now	worth	$10.	Now,	the	same	division	occurs	for	the	earnings.	If	you
remember	 the	 earnings	 for	 the	 whole	 business	 (or	 net	 income)	 was	 $100,
therefore	 the	 earnings	 per	 share	 (EPS)	 is	 $100/100	 =	 $1	 per	 share.	 In	 the
previous	example,	we	found	the	P/E	ratio	for	the	entire	business.	Now	we	are
going	to	find	the	P/E	for	an	individual	share.

```
Market	Price	per	share	 Earnings	per	share	(EPS)	=	P E
$10/$1	=	10
```
As	you	can	see,	the	P/E	for	the	entire	company	is	the	same	number	for	one	share.

As	we	have	seen	in	this	example,	it	would	be	safe	to	conclude	that	we	want	to
invest	in	companies	that	have	low	P/E	ratios.	Why	pay	a	higher	price	for	a	single


$1	of	earnings	when	you	don’t	have	to?

Unfortunately,	 investing	 is	 not	 that	 simple.	 The	 P/E	 ratio	 is	 simply	 a	 current
snapshot	 in	 time.	 It	 looks	 at	 the	 company’s	 present	 performance	 in	 order	 to
determine	the	value	of	its	future	performance.	This	is	often	a	dangerous	path	if
you	fail	to	consider	the	other	variables.

As	you	might	suspect,	a	lot	of	things	can	happen	to	the	juice	stand.	The	weather
that	summer	may	be	bad	or	another	juice	stand	may	open	right	next	to	ours.
Basically,	we	can’t	be	sure	of	the	$100	in	earnings	the	following	years.

Many	investors	have	faced	the	same	dilemma,	and	therefore	they	turn	to	a	notion
called	“forward	P/E”	instead.	The	idea	behind	this	is	that	it	uses	the	projected
earnings	instead	of	the	past/present	earnings.	Typically,	these	future	estimations
are	based	on	the	average	estimates	of	analysts.

So,	if	we	have	decided	to	look	at	the	forward	P/E	for	our	juice	stand,	we	might
estimate	that	we	could	make	$200	in	earnings.	Our	forward	P/E	would	therefore
be	 $1,000	 _$200	 =	 5.	 While	 this	 looks	 more	 attractive,	 it	 also	 shows	 that	 a
forward	P_ E	to	some	extent	is	a	matter	of	guesswork	and	opinion.

Warren	Buffett	is	a	conservative	investor.	He	suggests	that	you	buy	stocks	with	a
P/E	ratio	below	15—or,	in	other	words,	the	return	should	at	the	very	least	be
6.67%	(which	is	1/15)	annually.	He	does	not	buy	into	hopes	and	dreams	and	he
does	not	think	he	can	spot	the	new	Microsoft.	Instead,	he	buys	into	a	company
that	is	already	making	a	decent	profit	compared	to	the	price	he	pays.

Furthermore,	Warren	Buffett	is	well	aware	that	earnings	can	be	unstable.	In	the
example	of	the	juice	stand,	you	saw	how	an	increase	in	the	estimated	earnings
dramatically	 changed	 the	 P/E	 when	 we	 used	 $200	 of	 earnings	 instead	 of	 the
original	$100.	He	therefore	places	great	emphasis	on	the	stability	of	earnings.
Stability	 is	 the	 basis	 for	 every	 valuation	 technique	 because	 it	 minimizes
variability	and	risk.

**Rule	3—Low	price-to-book	ratio**

Another	simple	valuation	technique	is	the	price-to-book	ratio	(P/B).	Let	me	give
you	a	simple	example:	say	that	you	pay	$10,000	for	a	car	(the	price);	you	will
now	have	an	asset	worth	$10,000	(the	book	value).	The	P/B	would	be	1	in	this
situation.

For	businesses,	the	principle	is	the	same,	though	the	company	might	own	more
assets	and	have	divided	the	ownership	into	shares.	Here	is	the	simple	formula:


Price-to-Book	Value	Ratio	=	Market	Price	per	share	/	Book	Value	per	share

As	 you	 will	 recall,	 we	 first	 introduced	 equity	 in	 Chapter	 3.	 You	 saw	 the
following	figures:

Equity	is	what	the	company	owns	(asset)	subtracted	by	what	the	company	has
borrowed	(liability).	As	equity	and	book	value	are	the	same,	Price	to	Book	value
or	P/B	also	measures	how	much	the	investor	pays	for	every	$1	of	the	company’s
equity.	So	let’s	demonstrate	this	idea	with	an	example.	Looking	at	the	$38,000
of	equity	from	the	chart	above,	let’s	turn	it	into	a	P/B	ratio.	Let’s	assume	that
this	company	is	broken	down	into	100	shares.	Based	on	that	number,	we	know
that	the	book	value	would	be	$380	per	share	(the	math	is	$38,000/100	shares).
We	also	need	to	assume	a	market	price	for	one	share,	so	let’s	use	$570	per	share.
In	order	to	calculate	the	P/B	ratio,	we	will	simply	conduct	the	following	math:
P/B	=	$570/$380	=	1.5.	As	you	can	see,	the	ratio	has	no	units.	So	what	does	1.5
mean?

This	means	that	if	the	P/B	is	1.5,	you	pay	a	market	price	of	$1.5	for	every	$1	of
equity	on	the	company’s	books.	Anytime	you	do	this	calculation,	the	last	part	of
the	sentence	will	always	be	$1	of	equity;	for	example,	if	the	P/B	was	5,	you
would	 say	 that	 you’re	 paying	 $5.0	 for	 every	 $1	 of	 equity	 on	 the	 company’s
books.	As	you	can	quickly	see,	a	higher	ratio	is	less	exciting	because	it	means
you’re	paying	more	money	to	own	less	equity.	If	the	ratio	is	below	1,	like	.50,
that	means	you’re	paying	50	cents	for	every	$1	of	equity.

Now,	you	might	immediately	come	to	the	conclusion	that	the	lowest	P/B	ratio	on
the	 market	 is	 going	 to	 give	 you	 the	 best	 value,	 but	 that	 would	 be	 a	 bad
assumption.	To	demonstrate	what	I	mean,	let’s	assume	you	have	an	opportunity
to	purchase	a	company	that	has	a	P/B	of	0.50.	Although	you’re	purchasing	the
equity	of	the	business	at	a	severe	discount,	you	must	also	ask	yourself,	“What’s
behind	 the	 equity.”	 When	 you	 ask	 that	 question,	 you	 might	 find	 out	 that	 the
company	manufactures	analog	TV	antennas.	As	you	think	about	the	demand	for


this	1970	product,	you	might	also	realize	that	the	company	hasn’t	made	a	profit
in	the	last	four	years.	None	of	that	is	going	to	be	reflected	in	the	simple	P/B	ratio
of	0.50.	You	need	to	dig	deeper	in	order	to	see	the	product	and/or	earnings.

Now,	this	doesn’t	mean	that	every	company	with	a	low	P/B	is	a	dying	company.
In	fact,	during	depressed	markets,	you’ll	often	find	many	great	companies	(that
still	have	strong	profits)	trade	below	their	book	value.	Your	job	is	to	get	the
whole	picture—don’t	just	look	at	the	P/B	ratio,	you	need	to	compare	it	to	the
company’s	earnings,	ROE,	and	debt	(to	name	a	few)	all	at	the	same	time.

Warren	Buffett’s	mentor	Benjamin	Graham	would	try	to	find	companies	that	had
a	P/B	ratio	of	below	1.5	as	a	threshold	for	indicating	value.	Although	you	can	go
above	 this	 limit,	 just	 ensure	 you	 understand	 the	 risks	 of	 paying	 such	 a	 high
premium	for	ownership.	Just	as	Warren	Buffett	likes	to	buy	himself	into	a	decent
part	of	the	profit	at	a	low	price,	he	also	wants	a	part	of	the	equity	at	a	low	price.
If	 you	 decide	 to	 buy	 a	 company	 with	 a	 high	 P/B,	 one	 of	 the	 best	 ways	 to
minimize	your	exposure	to	risk	is	to	ensure	the	company	has	a	large	moat—or
durable	competitive	advantage.

**Rule	4—Set	a	safe	discount	rate**

So	let’s	start	talking	about	determining	the	intrinsic	value	of	a	stock.	To	find	the
value	of	any	stock,	a	discount	rate	must	always	be	determined.	Let	me	provide
an	example	from	my	personal	life:	I	once	had	a	discussion	with	my	children
about	money.	I	asked	them	some	simple	questions:	“Would	you	rather	have	a
dollar	 today,	 or	 two	 dollars	 tomorrow?”	 They	 responded,	 “Two	 dollars
tomorrow.”	I	then	asked,	“Would	you	like	to	have	a	dollar	today	or	two	dollars
next	week?”	They	responded,	with	a	little	hesitation,	“Two	dollars	next	week.”

Trying	to	reach	their	breaking	point,	I	asked,	“Would	you	like	to	have	a	dollar
today	or	two	dollars	next	year?”	They	quickly	replied,	“I	want	the	dollar	right
now—and	stop	asking	me	silly	questions.”

Although	the	questioning	seemed	a	little	annoying	at	the	time,	the	purpose	was
very	 profound.	 A	 dollar	 today	 has	 a	 completely	 different	 value	 than	 a	 dollar
tomorrow.	So	you	might	be	wondering,	how	can	I	compare	the	value	of	future
dollars	and	present	dollars?	The	answer	is	by	using	a	discount	rate.

By	using	a	discount	rate,	an	investor	can	take	future	dollars	(or	expected	dollars)
and	turn	them	into	present	dollars.	The	beauty	of	this	approach	is	an	investor	can
take	a	business’s	estimated	future	cash	flows	and	discount	them	back	to	today’s
value.	 This	 approach	 allows	 investors	 like	 Warren	 Buffett	 to	 estimate	 that


company	XYZ	is	worth	$100—even	though	it	might	be	trading	for	$80.	That
$100	value	is	called	the	 _intrinsic	value_ ,	or	 _real	value_.

So	what	discount	rate	should	you	use?

Well,	the	answer	to	that	question	depends	on	your	tolerance	for	risk.	Let’s	say
you	believe	a	particular	investment	is	extremely	risky.	Because	this	investment
is	so	risky,	you	will	want	a	very	large	return.	Let’s	use	an	extreme	example	and
say	you	want	a	50%	return	on	your	money	annually	because	the	risk	is	so	high.
In	this	case,	your	discount	rate	would	be	50%.

On	 the	 opposite	 side	 of	 the	 spectrum,	 let’s	 talk	 about	 a	 low-risk	 investment.
What	 should	 your	 minimal	 acceptable	 return	 be?	 Warren	 Buffett’s	 opinion	 is
that	no	investment	should	yield	a	lower	return	than	a	federally	issued	bond.	The
reason	he	holds	this	opinion	is	because	the	Federal	Reserve	can	simply	print
more	money	in	order	to	fulfill	its	interest	obligations;	therefore,	if	a	ten-year
bond	has	a	3%	return,	the	investor	should	never	discount	a	ten-year	investment
decision	lower	than	3%	annually.

When	using	a	discount	rate,	its	higher	or	lower	value	will	drastically	change	the
intrinsic	 value	 of	 an	 asset.	 In	 short,	 a	 higher	 discount	 rate	 produces	 a	 lower
intrinsic	value,	whereas	a	lower	discount	rate	produces	a	higher	intrinsic	value.
But	don’t	let	this	confuse	you.	Let	me	demonstrate	what	I’m	talking	about.

Let’s	say	we	are	interested	in	buying	a	company	called	XYZ.	We	believe	that
company	XYZ	is	going	to	produce	$100	of	cash	flow	(or	profit)	over	the	next
ten	years.	Therefore,	at	the	end	of	ten	years,	you’ll	have	$100	of	cash	in	your
hand.	Now,	what	would	you	be	willing	to	pay	 _today_ 	for	that	$100,	ten	years	from
now?

In	 order	 to	 solve	 that	 generic	 question,	 let’s	 start	 with	 a	 basic	 time-value	 of
money	equation.

PV	=	present	value	or	intrinsic	value	today

FV	=	future	value

i	=	discount	rate

n	=	number	of	years

Let’s	first	solve	the	equation	for	the	PV	(or	intrinsic	value):


Now	that	we	have	our	equation	ready,	let’s	demonstrate	how	the	intrinsic	value
of	company	XYZ	changes	with	the	two	different	discount	rates	(3%	and	50%).
We	will	start	with	3%.

So	here’s	what	that	means:	if	you	could	buy	company	XYZ	for	$74.41	today,
you’ll	earn	a	3%	return	annually	for	the	next	ten	years.	Remember,	owning	XYZ
will	put	$100	in	your	hand	at	the	end	of	ten	years.

Now,	let’s	do	the	same	thing	for	the	50%	discount	rate.

Wow,	you	weren’t	expecting	that,	were	you?	So	here’s	what	this	means:	if	you
could	buy	company	XYZ	for	$1.73	today,	you’ll	earn	a	50%	return	annually	for
the	next	ten	years—assuming	company	XYZ	can	actually	produce	the	$100	of
cash	flow	we	estimated.

Remember,	in	both	scenarios	(3%	or	50%),	the	end	result	was	the	same:	you
would	have	$100	in	your	hand	after	ten	years.	The	difference	is,	the	3%	rate	was
used	 if	 the	 investor	 was	 comfortable	 with	 the	 expectation	 of	 the	 company
actually	producing	$100	of	earnings	during	the	next	ten	years.	With	this	discount
rate,	the	investor	would	be	willing	to	pay	a	higher	price	for	the	investment—i.e.,
the	price	was	$74.41.	On	the	other	hand,	a	50%	rate	was	used	if	the	investor	was


uncomfortable	with	the	expectation	of	the	company	being	able	to	produce	$100
of	earnings	during	the	next	ten	years.	In	this	case,	the	investor	wants	to	pay	a
very	low	price	to	compensate	for	the	high	risk	of	ownership.	At	a	50%	discount
rate,	the	intrinsic	value	was	a	low	$1.73	for	the	investment.

So	you’re	probably	still	asking,	“What	discount	rate	should	I	use?”

Well,	 let’s	 flip	 that	 question	 on	 its	 head	 and	 look	 at	 it	 from	 a	 different
perspective.	Instead,	let’s	determine	what	the	discount	rate	is.	One	thing	we	must
remember	is	that	Mr.	Market	is	always	offering	us	a	new	price	for	company
XYZ.	Because	we	have	a	market	price,	we	can	determine	the	current	discount
rate	or	potential	rate	of	return.

In	order	to	solve	this	problem,	let’s	rearrange	our	formula	to	solve	for	i.

Now,	let’s	assume	that	company	XYZ	is	trading	on	the	stock	market	for	$60	a
share.	Is	that	a	good	price	based	on	the	cash	flow	we	expect	to	receive	($100	at
the	end	of	ten	years)?	Well,	let’s	find	out	what	kind	of	return	that	will	give	us
annually—or	in	other	words,	what	discount	rate	gives	us	that	$60	market	price.
With	 this	 new	 knowledge	 (of	 the	 market	 price,	 or	 selling	 price),	 we	 can
determine	our	expected	yield.


Now	for	the	big	question:	is	a	5.2%	return	a	sufficient	growth	on	your	money	for
the	risk	you	assume	in	owning	company	XYZ?	Considering	a	federal	bond	is
providing	a	3%	return,	you	might	determine	the	extra	return	from	company	XYZ


is	not	worth	the	risk.	Others	might	disagree.	More	importantly,	there	might	be
other	investment	opportunities	that	could	produce	a	larger	return	with	less	risk.
These	decisions	are	the	definition	of	opportunity	cost.	This	is	what	the	discount
rate	is	all	about.

At	the	start	of	this	section,	you’ll	remember	the	questions	I	asked	my	children
about	 the	 time	 value	 of	 money.	 At	 a	 certain	 point	 in	 time,	 my	 children,
unknowingly,	discounted	the	future	cash	flow	at	a	rate	that	made	them	choose
the	present	dollar	over	the	future	dollars.	Smart	investors	understand	this	process
like	the	backs	of	their	hands.

As	we	move	into	the	next	section,	you’ll	find	the	calculation	for	intrinsic	value
has	more	parts.	The	example	in	this	section	was	to	provide	a	foundation	for	what
a	 discount	 rate	 is	 and	 how	 it’s	 used	 to	 compare	 opportunity	 costs.	 The
calculation	used	in	this	section	was	an	abbreviated	approach	for	demonstration
purposes;	 you’ll	 want	 to	 use	 the	 advice	 given	 in	 the	 following	 rule	 for
determining	the	intrinsic	value.

**Rule	5—Buy	undervalued	stocks—Determining	intrinsic	value**

So	far	we	have	seen	basic	valuation	techniques	like	P/E	and	P/B	which	provide	a
snapshot	 in	 time	 of	 whether	 a	 stock	 may	 be	 undervalued.	 Determining	 the
intrinsic	 value	 of	 a	 company	 is	 a	 more	 laborious	 process,	 but	 it’s	 likely	 to
produce	more	accurate	results	and	estimates.

Warren	Buffett	says,	“Intrinsic	value	can	be	defined	simply:	It	is	the	discounted
value	of	the	cash	that	can	be	taken	out	of	a	business	during	its	remaining	life.”

So	as	we	look	at	that	quote,	it	has	two	main	parts;	a	discount	rate	and	an	estimate
of	 future	 cash	 flows.	 So	 let’s	 learn	 some	 techniques	 for	 determining	 both	 of
those	components.

The	first	thing	you’ll	learn	about	determining	the	intrinsic	value	of	a	company	is
that	 different	 techniques	 exist.	 At	 the	 end	 of	 the	 day,	 any	 calculation	 for
determining	 a	 company’s	 future	 cash	 flows	 is	 going	 to	 have	 numerous
assumptions.	In	this	book,	we	are	going	to	discuss	two	different	intrinsic	value
calculations	so	you	have	the	flexibility	to	choose	which	approach	you	prefer.
The	 first	 calculation	 is	 called	 a	 discount	 cash	 flow	 calculation.	 The	 second
calculation	is	a	variant	of	the	discount	cash	flow	calculation	and	it	values	stocks
similarly	to	fixed	income	bonds.	Although	both	approaches	might	sound	a	little
confusing,	 there’s	 no	 need	 to	 worry—we’ll	 go	 step	 by	 step	 and	 provide
examples	on	the	following	pages.


It	is	important	to	understand	that	every	valuation	technique	can	be	boiled	down
to	 one	 thing:	 “How	 much	 money	 can	 I	 expect	 to	 get	 in	 return	 for	 my	 initial
investment?”

#### The	Discount	Cash	Flow	(DCF)	Intrinsic	Value	Model

```
Let’s	start	with	the	“discount	cash	flow”	model.	It	consists	of	just	six	steps.
Once	you	determine	what	the	intrinsic	value	is,	you’ll	want	to	compare
that	value	to	the	market	price.	The	difference	between	value	and	price	is
where	you’ll	see	your	margin	of	safety.
Below	is	an	overview	of	the	six	steps	for	the	DCF	model.
Overview	of	steps
Estimate	the	free	cash	flow
Estimate	the	discount	factor
Calculate	the	discounted	value	of	free	cash	flow	for	ten	years
Calculate	the	discounted	perpetuity	free	cash	flow	(beyond	ten	years)
Calculate	the	intrinsic	value
Calculate	the	intrinsic	value	per	share
Assumptions
Current	free	cash	flow:	$1,000
The	first	ten	years’	annual	growth	rate	of	the	free	cash	flow:	6%
Discount	rate:	10%
Long-term	growth	rate:	3%
Shares	outstanding:	1,000
Before	we	go	through	the	first	step,	I	want	to	highlight	that	a	discount	cash
flow	 calculator	 is	 provided	 at	 BuffettsBooks.com.	 The	 calculator	 goes
through	the	steps	you’re	about	to	learn.	On	the	website,	there	is	also	an
instructional	video	that	you	can	watch	to	help	complement	the	reading.	If
you	would	like	to	access	the	calculator	and	the	video,	the	Web	address	is:
http://www.buffettsbooks.com/security-analysis/intrinsic-value-calculator-
dcf.html
So	let’s	get	started	with	the	first	step.
```

## 1.	Estimate	the	free	cash	flow

```
In	investing,	there	is	one	type	of	cash	flow	that	is	more	important	than	any
other.	That	is	cash	flow	that	is	 free. 	This	is	the	money	that	can	be	used
solely	to	benefit	the	owner,	either	by	distributing	the	money	back	through
dividends,	paying	off	debt,	buying	new	assets,	or	even	buying	back	shares.
Near	 the	 end	 of	 Chapter	 8	 (in	 the	 ratio	 section	 for	 the	 Cash	 Flow
Statement),	I	go	into	more	depth	on	how	to	calculate	free	cash	flow.	For
now,	you	can	think	of	free	cash	flow	as	the	profit	that	can	be	paid	to	the
owners	 without	 negatively	 impacting	 future	 performance.	 It’s	 very
important	 that	 you	 select	 a	 conservative	 estimate	 for	 free	 cash	 flow
because	the	entire	intrinsic	value	calculation	is	based	on	this	number.
For	simplicity,	let’s	assume	that	the	base	year’s,	or	current	year’s	free	cash
flow	is	$1,000.	Let’s	also	assume	it	will	grow	steadily	by	6%	annually	for
the	next	10	years.	If	that	were	the	case,	during	the	future	years,	the	free
cash	flow	would	look	like	this:
```
```
The	formula	for	determining	the	free	cash	flow	for	any	given	year	into	the
future	is	the	following:
```
```
FCFn	=	Free	cash	flow	for	year	n
BYFCF	=	Base	year	free	cash	flow	(current	free	cash	flow)
n	=	the	number	of	years	into	the	future
GR	=	the	company’s	estimated	annual	growth	rate
As	you	think	about	what	percent	you	should	use	for	the	annual	growth	rate
```

(GR),	it’s	important	to	consider	qualitative	and	quantitative	factors.	Your
input	for	this	number	will	drastically	impact	the	intrinsic	value	so	choose
wisely	 and	 conservatively.	 A	 great	 starting	 point	 for	 picking	 a	 percent
would	be	an	assessment	of	the	company’s	historical	free	cash	flow	growth
rate.	That	can	be	found	during	your	assessment	of	the	company’s	previous
cash	flow	statements.

As	 you	 might	 expect,	 using	 past	 performance	 is	 only	 helpful	 if	 the
company	 demonstrates	 stable	 and	 predictable	 patterns.	 Another	 starting
point	could	be	the	company’s	average	return	on	equity	(ROE)	over	the	past
five	 years.	 Again,	 this	 is	 reliant	 on	 predictable	 past	 patterns	 of
performance.	 If	 using	 the	 ROE,	 ensure	 that	 its	 trend	 is	 either	 flat	 or
increasing.	If	a	company’s	ROE	has	consistently	decreased	over	the	past
years,	it’s	probably	a	risky	approach	to	use	the	average	to	estimate	future
performance.	As	discussed	in	earlier	sections,	looking	at	past	results	will
only	take	your	assessment	so	far.	If	you	remember,	the	current	value	of	the
company	is	reliant	on	the	company’s	ability	to	earn	dollars	into	the	future.
After	spending	time	analyzing	the	company’s	past	performance,	I	would
recommend	taking	a	close	look	at	what	the	company	has	planned	for	the
future.

Analysis	of	future	performance	will	lead	to	an	objective	assessment	that
involves	qualitative	features;	for	example,	study	the	company’s	research
and	 development	 efforts	 and	 get	 a	 feel	 for	 their	 future	 products.	 More
importantly,	look	hard	at	the	company’s	current	products	or	services	and
determine	 how	 they	 might	 perform	 as	 competition	 increases	 and	 time
marches	on.	If	you	feel	like	the	company’s	current	product	line	is	going	to
be	 obsolete	 in	 five	 years,	 you’ll	 probably	 want	 to	 avoid	 using	 past
performance	indicators	for	estimating	future	cash	flow	growth.	Although
future	earnings	projections	are	rarely	accurate,	it	might	help	to	look	at	the
trends	 that	 analysts	 predict;	 for	 example,	 if	 you’re	 assessing	 that	 a
company’s	free	cash	flow	will	increase	by	6%	over	the	next	ten	years,	but
analysts	 are	 showing	 that	 the	 earnings	 will	 decrease	 by	 10%	 next	 year,
there’s	probably	a	major	disconnect	between	your	assessment	and	reality.

As	you	can	see,	this	number	is	very	important.	It’s	ultimately	based	on	the
company’s	ability	to	earn	even	more	into	the	future.	If	you	use	an	extra
high	growth	rate,	then	your	optimism	for	profits	maybe	blinding	your	need
for	 safety.	 Be	accurate,	 be	balanced,	 and	 be	careful	 (the	 ABCs)	 when


selecting	a	future	growth	rate.


## 2.	Estimate	the	discount	factor

```
The	discount	factor	is	very	similar	to	the	discount	rate.	The	only	difference
is	the	discount	factor	is	applied	to	a	specific	point	in	time.	Although	the
two	 terms	 sound	 very	 similar,	 their	 application	 is	 not.	 Be	 sure	 you
understand	 that	 the	 discount	 rate	 is	 simply	 one	 number—a	 number	 you
select	based	on	risk.	The	discount	factor	is	numerous	numbers	depending
on	what	year	in	the	future	you’re	talking	about—it	is	calculated	after	you
select	a	discount	rate.	Let’s	get	our	hands	dirty	so	the	application	makes
sense.	The	formula	for	the	discount	factor	is:
```
```
DFn	=	The	discount	factor	during	year	n
DR	=	Discount	rate
n	=	Year	being	discounted
As	you	saw	previously,	the	discount	rate	is	an	extremely	important	concept
to	understand.	In	essence,	the	discount	rate	represents	the	return	you	would
like	to	receive	for	owning	the	company.	If	the	company	is	very	risky,	for
example,	 you	 might	 want	 at	 least	 a	 20%	 annual	 return—therefore	 your
discount	rate	would	be	20%.
A	great	way	to	think	about	the	selection	of	a	discount	rate	is	to	put	yourself
into	the	shoes	of	the	bank	lender.	Let’s	say	you	have	a	new	business	that’s
looking	to	borrow	money.	Since	the	company	might	have	a	lot	of	unknown
risks,	you	require	a	higher	yield	on	the	money	you	lend.	It’s	also	important
to	consider	what	kind	of	return	you	could	get	from	other	opportunities.	For
example,	 if	 you	 could	 get	 a	 7%	 return	 on	 a	 federally	 issued	 bond,	 you
should	never	accept	a	lower	return	than	that.	Therefore,	you	may	want	to
use	a	discount	rate	that’s	at	least	double	the	return	of	the	zero	risk	federal
bond—i.e.,	14%.	This	isn’t	something	that	I	can	provide.	It’s	purely	based
on	your	willingness	to	assume	risk.	The	lower	the	discount	rate	you	select,
the	more	risk	you	assume;	for	example,	if	you	select	a	discount	rate	of	5%,
that	means	the	intrinsic	value	will	be	based	on	an	annual	return	of	5%.	Be
careful	and	leave	yourself	a	margin	of	safety.	If	you’re	new	to	this	process,
```

you’ll	probably	want	to	always	start	with	a	discount	rate	of	higher	than
10%	until	you	develop	a	firm	understanding	of	the	process	and	the	risks
involved.

Now,	 to	 demonstrate	 the	 calculation	 of	 a	 discount	 factor,	 we’ll	 start	 by
selecting	 a	 discount	 rate	 of	 10%—which	 represents	 marginal	 risk.	 As	 a
result,	our	discount	factor	for	the	first	year	would	be	the	following:

Now,	if	we	were	to	do	this	calculation	for	each	future	year,	you	would	find
that	the	DF	becomes	larger	and	larger;	for	example,	here	is	the	DF	for	the
second	future	year.

Using	this	approach,	let’s	determine	the	DF	for	all	ten	future	years.

That	completes	this	step.	Make	sure	you	don’t	move	forward	until	you’re
comfortable	with	the	math	behind	the	chart	above.

**3.	Calculate	the	discounted	value	of	free	cash	flow	for	ten	years**

Now	that	we	have	our	estimated	cash	flows	and	a	corresponding	discount
factor,	we	can	combine	them	into	a	discounted	free	cash	flow	chart.

The	simple	formula	for	arriving	at	the	discounted	free	cash	flow	for	each
year	is:


```
DFCFn	=	Discounted	free	cash	flow	for	year	n
FCFn	=	Free	cash	flow	for	year	n
DFn	=	Discount	factor	for	year	n
```
When	 you	 look	 at	 the	 numbers	 above,	 the	 discounted	 FCF	 number	 is
determined	 by	 dividing	 the	 free	 cash	 flow	 by	 the	 discount	 factor.	 Once
each	 year’s	 discounted	 FCF	 is	 determined,	 all	 the	 years	 are	 summed
together.

Therefore,	the	sum	of	all	the	DFCF	values	for	ten	years	is	$8,203.

Although	it	might	feel	like	we	are	complete	with	our	calculation,	we’re
only	about	half	way	there.	If	you	remember	Buffett’s	quote	about	intrinsic
value,	 it	 calls	 for	 the	 discounted	 value	 of	 all	 future	 cash	 flows.	 So	 far
we’ve	only	done	the	first	ten	years.	The	next	step	solves	that	problem.

**4.	 Calculate	 the	 discounted	 perpetuity	 free	 cash	 flow	 (beyond	 ten
years)**

When	you	are	buying	a	company,	you	are	not	only	entitled	to	receive	the
cash	flow	over	the	next	ten	years;	you	own	the	rights	to	receive	cash	flows
_for	as	long	as	it	exists._

For	this	reason,	we	also	need	to	include	the	company’s	 _perpetual_ 	value.	To
do	this,	we	must	look	at	the	cash	flows	in	the	years	beyond	the	tenth	year.
Remember,	we	have	already	calculated	the	discounted	value	of	FCF	for
the	 first	 ten	 years	 in	 step	 3.	 The	 formula	 for	 perpetual	 value	 is	 the
following:

```
DPCF	=	Discounted	perpetuity	cash	flow
BYFCF	=	Base	year	free	cash	flow
GR	=	Growth	rate	of	the	free	cash	flow
DR	=	Discount	rate
LGR	=	Long-term	growth	rate
```
Based	on	the	numbers	we	have	used	so	far,	the	listed	variables	have	the


following	values:

```
DPCF	=	We	are	solving	for	this
BYFCF	=	$1,000
GR	=	6%
DR	=	10%
LGR	=	?
```
As	you	can	see,	there’s	a	new	variable	that	needs	to	be	determined—the
long-term	growth	rate.	Now,	this	number	is	nearly	impossible	to	predict.
For	anyone	who	thinks	they’ll	be	able	to	predict	a	company’s	ability	to
grow	their	profits	beyond	the	ten-year	mark,	best	of	luck.	Although	we
might	 feel	 uncomfortable	 making	 those	 kinds	 of	 predictions,	 we	 can,
however,	make	a	general	assumption	by	asking	a	simple	question:

_Is	this	company	going	to	have	the	capacity	to	remain	relevant	beyond	ten
years?_

For	example,	do	you	think	a	company	like	Coca-Cola	will	continue	to	exist
and	sustain	their	market	share	beyond	the	ten-year	mark?	If	the	answer	is
yes,	then	my	recommendation	is	to	use	a	long-term	growth	rate	between	2
or	3	percent.	Although	we	might	have	a	lot	of	confidence	that	Coca-Cola
would	 continue	 to	 be	 a	 profitable	 business	 well	 into	 the	 future,	 simply
using	the	rate	of	inflation	(2-3%)	protects	your	estimate	from	being	too
optimistic.	Again,	this	is	a	technique.	You	have	the	capacity	to	use	any	rate
you	would	like,	but	just	be	prepared	for	the	risk	you	assume	by	being	too
optimistic	in	your	forecasts.

Based	on	those	factors,	let’s	determine	the	cash	flows	beyond	the	ten-year
mark.	 Below	 is	 the	 calculation	 with	 the	 numbers	 we	 substituted	 for	 the
variables	(remember	we	are	using	0.03	=	LGR	for	the	long-term	growth
rate):

###### DPCF	=	$9,790

Now,	depending	on	your	background	in	math,	that	calculation	might	be	a
little	 tricky.	 If	 that’s	 the	 case,	 I	 highly	 recommend	 you	 use	 the	 online
calculator	 at	 BuffettsBooks.com	 or	 Microsoft	 Excel	 to	 conduct	 the


calculation.	If	you	were	to	select	any	cell	in	Microsoft	Excel,	you	could
type	the	following	and	press	enter	to	get	the	right	answer:

=((1000*(1+0.06)^11*(1+0.03))/(0.10-0.03)*1/(1+0.10)^11)

Now	that	we	have	the	discounted	perpetuity	free	cash	flow,	we’re	almost
done!	Let’s	combine	our	cash	flows.


## 5.	Calculate	the	Intrinsic	value

```
As	 you	 might	 suspect,	 in	 order	 to	 calculate	 the	 intrinsic	 value	 (for	 the
entire	company),	we	need	to	add	the	first	ten	years	of	discounted	free	cash
flows	to	the	perpetuity	discounted	free	cash	flows.
Intrinsic	value	=	Sum	of	DFCF	for	ten	years	+	DPCF
Intrinsic	value	=	$8,203	+	$9,790
Intrinsic	value	=	$17,993
Now,	it’s	very	important	to	recognize	that	the	free	cash	flow	(which	is	the
number	that	started	this	calculation)	is	reported	for	the	entire	company;
therefore,	$17,993	might	be	in	millions	or	billions	of	dollars.	You	can	find
out	 how	 many	 digits	 have	 been	 rounded	 by	 looking	 at	 the	 cash	 flow
statement.	It	is	here	that	you’ll	see	a	note	that	typically	says,	“Values	in
Millions.”	This	means	that	the	intrinsic	value	of	the	entire	company	would
be	$17,993,000,000.	That’s	a	big	number	that	doesn’t	make	sense	to	a	lot
of	people,	so	let’s	fix	that	in	the	final	step.
```

## 6.	Calculate	the	Intrinsic	value	per	share

```
In	order	to	determine	the	intrinsic	value	per	share,	you’ll	need	to	reference
the	balance	sheet	or	Income	statement	to	see	how	many	common	shares
are	outstanding	in	the	company.	This	is	typically	reported	at	the	bottom	of
the	 balance	 sheet	 in	 a	 column	 labeled,	 Common	 Share	 Outstanding or
Ordinary	Shares	Outstanding. 	While	looking	at	the	bottom	of	the	balance
sheet,	be	sure	to	look	for	the	note	that	specifies	if	the	numbers	are	reported
in	millions	again.	If	so,	you’ve	got	a	simple	math	problem	because	you	can
simply	divide	your	intrinsic	value	from	step	5	by	the	number	of	common
shares	outstanding.	Let’s	assume,	for	example,	we	found	company	XYZ
has	1,000	shares	outstanding:
Intrinsic	value	per	share	=	Intrinsic	value	/	Common	shares	outstanding
Intrinsic	value	per	share	=	$17,993	/	1,000
Intrinsic	value	per	share	=	$17.99
It’s	very	important	to	note	how	many	zeros	have	been	rounded	off	the	free
cash	flow	and	shares	outstanding.	If	the	numbers	were	rounded	differently
(i.e.,	one	was	millions	and	the	other	was	billions),	you’ll	need	to	write	out
the	 full	 amount	 of	 digits	 in	 the	 final	 steps	 before	 you	 conduct	 your
division.	 It	 is	 very	 uncommon	 that	 the	 numbers	 would	 be	 rounded
differently.
So,	 here’s	 the	 big	 question:	 what	 the	 heck	 does	 $17.99	 mean?	 Well,	 it
means	this:	if	you	could	buy	one	share	of	company	XYZ	at	$17.99	you
could	 expect	 a	 10%	 annual	 return.	 As	 you	 remember,	 10%	 was	 our
discount	rate.	If	you	would	have	selected	a	higher	discount	rate,	like	20%,
you	would	find	that	your	intrinsic	value	would	be	lower.	The	reason	is
because	you	would	need	to	buy	company	XYZ	at	an	even	better	price	to
get	 the	 higher	 return.	 As	 you	 can	 see,	 the	 intrinsic	 value	 is	 completely
dependent	on	the	return	you	seek.	This	is	a	concept	that	very	few	people
actually	understand.	When	someone	tells	me	that	they	think	a	particular
company	has	an	intrinsic	value	of,	let’s	say,	$100,	I	quickly	respond,	“At
what	discount	rate?”	Talking	about	an	intrinsic	value	without	a	discount
rate	is	like	talking	about	the	yin	without	the	yang.
```

```
Let’s	wrap	this	up	and	put	it	into	a	practical	example.	Let’s	say	you	just
calculated	the	intrinsic	value	for	XYZ	at	$17.99	with	a	10%	discount	rate.
At	the	same	time,	let’s	say	company	XYZ	is	trading	on	the	stock	market
for	$25.04.	What	does	that	mean?
Simply	 put,	 you’ll	 need	 a	 lower	 discount	 rate	 for	 the	 intrinsic	 value	 to
match	the	current	trading	price	of	$25.04.	If	you	haven’t	noticed	yet,	the
intrinsic	 value	 and	 discount	 rate	 are	inversely	proportional.	 That	 means
when	one	goes	up,	the	other	goes	down;	therefore,	if	company	XYZ	is
trading	for	$25.04,	you	will	need	to	use	a	discount	rate	of	lower	than	10%.
How	much	lower?	Well,	that’s	a	very	tricky	math	problem.	Luckily	for
you,	 I’ve	 made	 an	 online	 calculator	 that	 automatically	 calculates	 the
corresponding	discount	rate	for	the	price	the	company	is	trading	for	on	the
stock	exchange.	For	this	particular	example,	a	market	price	of	$25.04	will
create	 a	 discount	 rate	 of	 8.14%—therefore,	 you	 can	 see	 that	 the	 higher
market	price	decreases	your	annual	expected	return.	Now	for	the	important
question:	are	you	still	willing	to	purchase	this	company	even	though	the
higher	market	price	creates	a	return	of	8.14%?	Only	you	can	answer	that
question.	 Since	 this	 is	 a	 generic	 example,	 underlying	 risks	 for	 owning
company	 XYZ	 aren’t	 considered.	 If	 they	 were,	 you	 would	 need	 to
qualitatively	 compare	 those	 risks	 to	 the	 yield	 you	 expect	 to	 receive
(8.14%).
```
#### The	BuffettsBooks	Intrinsic	Value	Model

```
The	 more	 familiar	 you	 become	 with	 valuing	 stocks,	 the	 quicker	 you’ll
realize	that	everyone	has	their	own	take	on	the	process.	Through	the	years,
I	have	really	tried	to	focus	on	the	hints	and	clues	that	Warren	Buffett	has
provided	 through	 his	 shareholder	 letters	 and	 countless	 interviews.	 It	 is
through	 those	 resources	 that	 I’ve	 found	 him	 repeatedly	 referencing	 the
similarities	between	the	valuation	of	bonds	and	stocks.	For	the	next	model,
you’ll	find	that	its	core	mathematics	is	based	on	a	bond	valuation	formula
that	has	been	converted	into	a	discount	cash	flow	model	for	stocks.	The
specifics	 of	 the	 calculation	 can	 be	 found	 in	 the	 Appendix	 of	 this	 book.
Since	the	math	for	this	valuation	technique	can	be	a	little	cumbersome,
I’ve	tried	to	keep	the	description	of	the	process	simple	in	this	portion	of
the	 book.	 Additionally,	 you	 can	 find	 this	 calculator	 on	 the
BuffettsBooks.com	website	along	with	a	video	tutorial.
```

Before	using	this	calculator,	I	want	to	strongly	emphasize	the	importance
of	 finding	 stable	 and	 predictable	 companies	 (Principle	 3).	 Like	 the
discount	 cash	 flow	 model,	 without	 using	 a	 company	 that	 generally	 has
predictable	earnings	and	actions,	you’ll	find	the	calculator	becomes	less
useful.	 A	 company	 like	 Exxon-Mobil,	 for	 example,	 has	 much	 more
predictable	 earnings	 than	 a	 newly	 minted	 public	 company	 like	 Twitter.
This	doesn’t	mean	that	Exxon-Mobil	will	produce	more	earnings	in	the
future;	it	simply	means	Exxon-Mobil	would	be	easier	to	value	because	it’s
a	 relatively	 stable	 business.	 This	 minimizes	 our	 exposure	 to	 risk	 in	 the
price	we	pay	for	owning	the	company.

The	 formula	 is	 very	 simple	 and	 only	 consists	 of	 four	 components.	 You
should	have	a	thorough	understanding	of	each	of	the	components	before
you	start	the	analysis.

```
Book	value	(Principle	3,	Rule	1)
Dividends	(Principle	3,	Rule	1)
Average	percent	change	in	book	value	per	year	(Principle	3,	Rule	1)
Discount	rate	(Principle	4,	Rule	3)
```
The	BuffettsBooks	Intrinsic	Value	Calculator	is	similar	to	the	DCF	model
presented	 earlier.	 It	 also	 generates	 an	 intrinsic	 value	 per	 share	 (with	 a
corresponding	discount	rate).	In	other	ways,	it	is	different;	for	example,	the
variables	for	assessing	the	future	cash	flows	are	found	through	a	different
process.	 Instead,	 you’ll	 be	 looking	 at	 how	 much	 money	 is	 expected	 to
actually	 flow	 back	 to	 the	 owner	 in	 terms	 of	 dividends	 and	 book	 value
growth.

The	 picture	 below	 is	 a	 screen-shot	 of	 the	 calculator’s	 inputs	 at
BuffettsBooks.com.	We	will	discuss	each	of	the	inputs	in	detail.	The	full

To	make	simple	use	of	this	calculator,	I	have	divided	the	approach	into
seven	easy	steps.	Once	you	have	tried	out	the	steps	a	couple	of	times,	you
will	be	able	to	do	the	calculation	quickly.	The	financial	inputs	required	for
using	the	calculator	are	all	disclosed	to	the	public	in	a	company’s	annual
report	 and	 should	 be	 easy	 to	 find	 on	 free	 Internet	 sites	 such	 as	 MSN
Money,	Yahoo	Finance,	Morningstar,	or	the	company’s	own	website.

**Overview	of	the	seven	steps	for	using	the	calculator**

```
Insert	book	values	and	find	the	average	book	value	growth	rate
```

```
Insert	cash	taken	out	of	the	business	(or	dividend)
Insert	the	current	book	value
Input	the	average	percent	change	in	book	value	per	year	(from	step	1)
Determine	the	number	of	years
Determine	the	discount	rate
Push	the	calculate	button
Assumptions
Current	book	value:	$30
Old	book	value:	$10
Number	of	years	between	the	two	book	value	figures:	10
Yearly	dividend:	$1
Discount	rate:	2.5%
Now,	enough	talk.	Let’s	get	down	to	business	and	use	the	calculator	with
an	example!
1)	Insert	book	values	and	find	the	average	book	value	growth	rate:
```
```
Current	Book	Value	($):			
```
```
Old	Book	Value	(S):			
```
```
#	of	Years	between	Book	Values:			
```
```
Average	Book	Value	change	(%):			
```
As	you	may	recall,	the	change	in	book	value	over	time	provides	clues	into	the
change	in	intrinsic	value.	That	is	what	we	are	trying	to	determine	in	this	step.
Our	starting	point	is	what	we	call	“current	book	value,”	and	in	this	generic
example	I	have	used	$30.	We	would	then	go	back	ten	years	and	look	for	the
“old	book	value,”	which	in	this	example	is	$10.	Our	calculator	generates	the
average	annual	output,	which	is	11.6	%.	If	you	are	having	problems	finding
these	terms	for	real	companies,	I	strongly	suggest	that	you	watch	the	video	on
the	calculator’s	Web	page	so	you	can	see	examples	of	where	to	find	these
variables.


So	 what	 does	 11.61%	 mean?	 It	 means	 that	 in	 the	 previous	 ten	 years,	 the
shareholders	have	seen	their	book	value	grow,	on	average,	by	11.6%	every
year.	This	is	equity	growth	that	is	ultimately	reflected	in	the	company’s	asset
growth	or	liability	reduction.	This	could	be	anything,	like	new	equipment	for
production,	or	an	increased	cash	account,	or	a	reduction	of	outstanding	debt.
Since	book	value	is	the	owner’s	claim	of	the	business,	the	shareholders	have
become	11.6%	wealthier	each	year	from	that	reinvested	capital.	As	we	move
forward,	this	number	is	going	to	help	us	estimate	how	much	the	company’s
equity	will	grow	in	the	future.	It’s	very	important	to	recognize	this	historical
growth	rate	as	a	trend.	It	doesn’t	definitively	suggest	that	future	growth	rates
will	be	the	same.	Instead,	it	should	be	used	as	a	rule	of	thumb	and	a	starting

cash	 flows.	 For	 the	 first	 input,	 we	 are	 going	 to	 estimate	 the	 average
dividend	payment	you	will	receive	in	the	next	ten	years—which	can	be	a
challenging	 task.	 If	 our	 chosen	 stock	 follows	 the	 first	 three	 principles,
however,	we	will	likely	see	a	stable	or	even	increasing	dividend	payment.
Look	at	the	trend	for	dividend	payments;	as	long	as	it	is	not	declining,	you
might	want	to	use	the	current	dividend	payment	as	the	estimate	for	the
average	 annual	 dividend	 over	 the	 next	 ten	 years.	 While	 this	 is	 often	 a
conservative	estimate,	you	can	feel	comfort	in	knowing	you	have	a	built-in
margin	of	safety	if	the	dividend	does	increase.

Remember	 to	 use	 the	 yearly	 dividend	 payment,	 and	 not	 the	 yield.	 The
yearly	dividend	payment	is	the	actual	payment	in	dollars,	while	the	yield	is
a	floating	key	ratio	that	compares	the	dividend	rate	to	the	market	price.	In

This	is	by	far	the	toughest	step	in	the	calculation.	In	any	valuation	model,
one	 has	 to	 make	 an	 estimate	 as	 to	 what	 the	 future	 will	 bring.	 Warren
Buffett	has	said	that	even	his	longtime	business	partner	Charlie	Munger
and	he	will	come	up	with	different	growth	rates	when	evaluating	a	stock
pick.	So	what	should	you	do?

If	the	company	is	stable,	a	good	starting	point	might	be	the	growth	rate	you
determined	in	the	first	step.	If	you	think	the	company’s	earnings	potential
is	decelerating,	you’ll	probably	want	to	use	a	more	conservative	number.
The	 important	 thing	 is	 that	 you	 feel	 you	 are	 using	 the	 most	 accurate
estimate	for	the	future.	For	simplicity,	I	have	used	the	figure	of	11.6%	that
was	 found	 in	 step	 1	 in	 this	 example.	 Remember,	 step	 1	 is	 a	 guide	 for
determining	the	book	value	growth	rate.	It	is	there	for	you	to	assess	and
determine	whether	you	think	the	company	will	continue	to	grow	at	that
previous	rate.	This	is	where	qualitative	estimates	and	opinions	need	to	be
merged	with	quantitative	analysis.

I	have	used	ten	years	as	my	finite	stopping	point	to	estimate	the	value	of
future	cash	flows.	This	investment	horizon	was	selected	so	the	stock	could
be	relatively	compared	to	a	finite	ten-year	federal	bond.	This	comparison
will	be	discussed	more	in	the	next	step.

```
6)	Determine	the	discount	rate
```
This	step	is	extremely	important.	In	principle	4,	rule	4,	and	also	the	DCF
model,	 we	 generally	 discussed	 how	 a	 discount	 rate	 works.	 If	 you	 don’t
remember	 the	 information	 from	 that	 section	 or	 it’s	 a	 little	 unclear,	 I
strongly	recommend	you	re-read	the	section.

When	we	talk	about	a	discount	rate,	we’re	really	talking	about	the	return
we	would	like	to	see	for	a	given	stock	based	on	the	risk	we	assume;	for
example,	if	we	were	to	input	a	discount	rate	of	20%,	then	the	calculator
would	 determine	 an	 intrinsic	 value	 for	 the	 stock	 that	 would	 allow	 the
investor	to	get	a	20%	annual	return.	As	one	might	expect,	I	would	likely
input	a	20%	discount	rate	if	I	felt	the	stock	had	a	lot	of	risk.


Instead	of	randomly	picking	a	discount	rate	based	on	feel	and	comfort	(i.e.,
30%	for	a	lot	of	risk,	and	5%	for	a	little	risk...	etc.),	Warren	Buffett	takes	a
different	 approach.	 Instead,	 he	 created	 a	 ruler,	 or	 measuring	 stick.	 That
measuring	 stick	 is	 the	 10-year	 Treasury	 note.	 Since	 Buffett	 holds	 the
opinion	 that	 the	 10-year	 Treasury	 note	 is	 zero	 risk	 to	 the	 investor,	 it
becomes	a	baseline;	for	example,	if	the	10-year	Treasury	note	is	returning
2.5%	today,	then	he	knows	that	should	be	his	minimum	acceptable	return
—therefore,	if	we	use	this	rate	as	our	discount	rate,	then	we	can	relatively
compare	all	investments	on	the	same	playing	field.

Now	this	is	very	important!	Because	you	are	using	2.5%	for	your	discount
rate,	this	also	means	that	the	intrinsic	value	will	price	the	stock	with	an
annual	return	of	2.5%	per	year.	Don’t	forget	that!	We’ll	discuss	this	more
after	you	calculate	the	intrinsic	value.	As	a	side	note,	you	can	find	daily
updates	 on	 the	 10-year	 Treasury	 note	 at	 this	 Web	 address:
[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-](http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-)

address:	to	the	right	side	of	the	discount	rate	input	box	on	the	calculator,

Intrinsic	Value:	$			

Based	on	the	estimates	and	assumption,	we	have	found	that	the	intrinsic
value	of	the	stock	is	$78.98	at	a	2.5%	discount	rate.	Let	us	make	a	quick
stop	and	look	behind	what	has	happened	in	the	six	simple	steps.

To	arrive	at	an	intrinsic	value	of	$78.98,	we	have	assumed	that	the	stock
will	pay	out	a	$1	annual	dividend	over	the	next	ten	years.	Additionally,	we
estimated	that	the	company	would	retain	the	rest	of	their	earnings	and	the
current	book	value	of	$30	will	grow	by	11.6%	each	year.	Based	on	those
cash	flows	over	the	next	ten	years,	we	have	discounted	that	money	by	the
risk-free	ten-year	federal	bond.

So	 what	 the	 heck	 does	 that	 mean?	 Well,	 based	 on	 your	 inputs,	 the
calculator	suggests	that	if	you	could	buy	this	stock	today	for	$78.98,	you
could	expect	a	2.5%	annual	return	for	the	next	ten	years.

To	make	things	more	realistic,	let’s	assume	that	this	company	is	currently
trading	on	the	stock	market	for	$90.	What	does	that	mean?	Assuming	all
your	estimates	for	future	earnings	are	valid,	this	means	you’ll	get	an	even
smaller	return	than	2.5%	if	you	buy	the	stock	at	$90.

So	your	next	question	is	probably	“How	much	smaller	than	2.5%?”	To
determine	that	with	the	calculator	is	relatively	simple,	but	it	does	require	a
little	trial	and	error.	To	figure	out	the	return	you	can	expect	based	on	the
company	 currently	 trading	 for	 $90,	 simply	 adjust	 the	 discount	 rate	 and
recalculate	until	the	output	(the	intrinsic	value)	reads	$90.

I’m	sure	it	didn’t	take	long	for	you	to	see	that	a	1%	discount	rate	roughly
gives	 you	 $90.	 So,	 going	 back	 to	 the	 ruler	 analogy	 with	 the	 10-year
Treasury	note,	we	can	now	draw	a	comparison.	We	can	assume	that	if	this
stock	was	priced	on	the	stock	market	for	$90,	the	Treasury	note	would
provide	a	2.5	times	better	return.	This	was	simply	determined	by	looking
at	the	stock	return	of	1%	at	its	current	market	price,	and	comparing	it	to
the	Treasury	note’s	return	of	2.5%.

Now,	let’s	assume	the	stock	market	price	was	below	our	initial	intrinsic
value	of	$78.98.	For	simplicity,	let’s	say	the	stock	trades	for	$60.	What’s
your	expected	return	at	that	price?


Like	before,	use	the	trial	and	error	method	to	adjust	the	discount	rate	to
5.5%	and	you	will	get	an	intrinsic	value	of	$60.	Again,	let’s	compare	the
stock	to	the	Treasury	note.	Based	on	a	market	price	of	$60,	the	stock	will
provide	a	2.2	times	higher	return	than	the	Treasury	note.

As	you	can	see,	the	intrinsic	value	is	always	relative	to	a	discount	rate.

**Finding	the	margin	of	safety**

As	you	can	see	from	the	previous	examples,	your	margin	of	safety	is	based
on	the	margin	of	return	you	expect	to	receive	over	the	10-year	federal	note.
If	you	find	a	stock	that	meets	all	four	principles	and	is	priced	on	the	market
at	a	15%	annual	return,	your	margin	of	safety	is	6	times	higher	than	a	2.5%
Treasury	note.

When	 you	 look	 at	 Buffett’s	 quote	 on	 intrinsic	 value,	 he	 states	 that
estimates	must	be	changed	if	interest	rates	change.	What	he	refers	to	is	the
margin	of	safety	an	investor	receives;	for	example,	let’s	say	that	we	have	a
stock	that’s	priced	at	$50	and	we	think	that	gives	us	a	7.5%	return.	Let’s
also	say	that	the	interest	rate	on	a	10-year	Treasury	note	changed	from
2.5%	to	5%	over	a	year’s	period.	Assuming	the	stock	price	didn’t	change
during	that	period	(to	make	the	example	simple),	we	can	quickly	see	how
our	margin	of	safety	has	drastically	changed	during	that	time.

When	interest	rates	were	2.5%,	our	stock	provided	a	return	3	times	higher
than	a	zero	risk	investment.

When	interest	rates	moved	to	5.0%,	our	stock	only	provided	1.5	times	the
return	of	the	zero	risk	investment.

Although	our	stock	didn’t	change	at	all,	our	margin	of	safety	did.	This	is
an	extremely	important	consideration	for	any	investor	to	understand.

Now,	everyone	likes	to	have	hard	fast	rules	for	making	decisions,	but	this
is	where	valuing	stocks	becomes	an	art.	Only	you	know	how	much	risk
you’re	willing	to	assume	for	any	particular	venture.

Regardless	of	which	method	we	use	to	assess	the	stock,	the	decision	is	the
same.	A	higher	discount,	or	margin	of	safety,	if	you	like,	will	result	in	a
higher	return	if	you	can	get	the	investment	at	the	corresponding	price.	If
you	 are	 not	 happy	 about	 the	 discount	 or	 the	 expected	 return	 you	 will
receive,	you	can	wait	for	the	stock	price	to	drop.	The	nice	thing	about	the
calculator	is	you	can	adjust	the	numbers	to	see	how	far	the	stock	price


should	drop	before	it	becomes	attractive.

**Which	calculator	should	I	use?**

As	you	obviously	saw,	you’ve	got	two	choices	for	calculating	the	intrinsic
value	 of	 a	 company.	 The	 DCF	 model	 allowed	 you	 to	 estimate	 the
company’s	value	buy	discounting	cash	flows	into	perpetuity.	The	second
calculator	provided	a	finite	solution	and	only	summed	the	cash	flows	for	a
ten-year	period.	Additionally,	the	two	calculators	used	different	numbers
to	 represent	 future	 cash	 flows.	 The	 DCF	 Model	 simply	 used	 free	 cash
flow,	 and	 the	 BuffettsBooks	 calculator	 used	 dividends	 plus	 book	 value
growth.

Like	 anything,	 there	 are	 advantages	 and	 disadvantages	 between	 both
choices.	 When	 deciding	 which	 calculator	 to	 use,	 the	 best	 advice	 is
probably	to	use	the	one	that	provides	the	most	conservative	estimate.	That
may	change	from	company	to	company	as	you	run	the	numbers	through
both	calculators.	Although	the	BuffettsBooks	calculator	may	be	easier	to
use	because	it	keeps	all	the	numbers	in	a	per	share	basis,	that	model	comes
with	limitations:

**Limitations	with	the	BuffettsBooks	intrinsic	calculator**

The	calculator	is	a	neat	tool,	but	there	are	typically	four	situations	where	it
is	less	useful	and	where	one	may	choose	the	DCF	model	instead.

```
i)	 It	 only	 works	 if	 a	 stock	 fulfills	 all	 four	 of	 Warren	 Buffett’s
principles
If	the	company	does	not	follow	Warren	Buffett’s	four	principles,	the
calculator	will	give	you	invalid	results.	The	calculator	is	built	upon
predictability	and	stability,	and	if	all	of	the	criteria	are	not	met,	the
output	 will	 likewise	 become	 unpredictable	 and	 unstable.
Specifically,	you’ll	want	to	find	companies	that	have	demonstrated
the	ability	to	have	stable	and	predictable	Returns	on	Equity	(ROE).	If
a	 company	 lacks	 certain	 aspects	 of	 the	 principles	 discussed,	 those
aspects	should	be	assessed	as	additional	risk	to	the	investor.	These
qualitative	 aspects	 should	 be	 accounted	 for	 by	 lowering	 the	 book
value	 growth	 rate,	 lowering	 the	 dividend	 rate,	 requiring	 a	 higher
discount	rate,	or	not	even	evaluating	the	stock	all	together.
ii)	 High-growth	companies
```

```
A	key	element	in	the	calculator	is	the	compounding	of	book	value.
High-growth	companies	naturally	have	a	better	opportunity	to	grow
their	book	value	compared	to	large,	slow-growth	companies,	even	if
it’s	for	a	limited	period	of	time.	These	growth	rates	will	yield	very
high	intrinsic	values	in	the	calculator.	I	would	recommend	not	using
more	than	13-15%	for	book	value	growth	in	the	calculator,	even	if
the	company	has	shown	much	higher	growth	over	the	past	ten	years.
For	 high-growth	 companies,	 the	 DCF	 model	 will	 provide	 better
estimates	because	you	can	limit	the	number	of	years	at	a	high	growth
rate.
iii)	 High	degree	of	share	buy-back
If	the	company	you’re	interested	in	uses	share	buy-backs	to	a	high
degree,	you	should	be	very	careful	using	the	calculator.	Buy-backs
distort	the	book	value,	which	in	turn	also	distorts	the	intrinsic	value.
You	 can	 determine	 how	 many	 share	 buy-backs	 a	 company	 is
conducting	by	looking	at	the	cash	flow	statement.	In	relative	terms,
if	the	buy-backs	are	generally	small,	it	will	have	a	small	impact	on
your	calculation,	but	if	it’s	corporate	strategy	to	reduce	the	number
of	shares	outstanding,	you’ll	probably	want	to	use	the	DCF	model
instead.
iv)	 Stock	Splits
If	the	company	you’re	interested	in	valuing	has	had	a	history	of	stock
splits,	 you’ll	 find	 that	 the	 historical	 book	 value	 growth	 rate	 isn’t
representative	of	its	actual	performance.	As	a	result,	you’ll	need	to
account	for	this	disparity	when	assessing	how	much	the	book	value
may	grow	in	the	future.	It	may	be	easier	to	use	the	DCF	model	in	an
effort	to	avoid	this	potential	error.
As	a	final	note,	I	want	to	highlight	that	the	BuffettsBooks	forum	has	a
great	community	of	very	smart	investors	who	can	help	explain	and	clarify
any	questions	you	have	relating	to	this	subject.	In	fact,	the	forum	already
has	 a	 thread	 of	 hundreds	 of	 questions	 and	 answers	 relating	 to	 the
calculation	of	intrinsic	value.	Feel	free	to	correspond	with	any	of	the	users

```
**Rule	6—The	right	time	to	sell**


One	factor	is	knowing	when	to	buy	a	stock.	Another,	which	is	just	as	important,
is	 knowing	 when	 to	 exit.	 Contrary	 to	 when	 you	 search	 for	 new	 investment
objects,	you	have	a	huge	advantage	when	it	comes	to	your	decision	to	sell.	You
already	know	the	company;	therefore	you	have	a	good	idea	of	the	fair	value,	and
also	the	company’s	future	path.	So	should	you	sell?

Often,	people	think	that	they	should	sell	either	because	a	stock	has	decreased	or
increased	by	a	certain	price.	Although	that	might	be	an	important	consideration,
that’s	only	one	factor	of	many,	in	a	larger	picture.

Unless	you	really	need	the	money	personally,	you	might	want	to	consider	the
impacts	 of	 capital	 gains	 and	 bank	 fees	 before	 you	 impulsively	 switch	 assets.
Looking	at	your	decisions	from	the	most	fundamental	level,	you	should	revert
back	to	Warren	Buffett’s	four	principles:

```
Is	the	company	still	managed	by	vigilant	leaders?
Does	 the	 company	 still	 have	 products	 and	 services	 that	 have	 long-term
prospects?
Are	 the	 company’s	 earnings	 and	 debt	 management	 still	 stable	 and
predictable?
Based	on	the	projected	cash	flows,	what	kind	of	return	do	you	expect	at
the	current	trading	price?
```
If	any	one	of	these	rules	is	being	breached,	it’s	probably	a	smart	decision	to
consider	the	opportunity	costs	associated	with	continuing	your	ownership	versus
purchasing	a	new	asset.

Another	valid	reason	for	selling	a	stock	would	be	if	you	feel	that	the	stock	is
taking	up	too	much	of	your	portfolio;	hence,	you	want	to	control	your	exposure
risk.	 This	 is	 really	 a	 very	 sensitive	 topic	 for	 many	 value	 investors.	 As	 I
mentioned	 earlier	 in	 the	 book,	 Warren	 Buffett	 strongly	 believes	 that
concentration	of	your	portfolio	actually	diminishes	your	risk.	He	compares	this
strategy	with	having	Michael	Jordan	on	your	team:	would	you	substitute	him
because	he	is	scoring	all	the	points?

Although	Buffett	likes	a	focused	portfolio,	he	still	keeps	more	than	ten	different
picks	in	his	portfolio.	In	the	end,	value	investors	should	make	this	decision	and
feel	comfortable.	If	you	feel	that	20%	or	35%	of	your	portfolio	in	one	stock	is
too	 risky,	 you	 should	 listen	 to	 your	 intuition.	 Even	 the	 best	 investors	 make
mistakes	when	picking	stocks,	and	you	don’t	want	to	be	fully	invested	with	only


one	stock,	even	if	you	deem	it	the	very	best	pick	on	the	entire	market.

So	let’s	go	back	to	Buffett’s	final	principle—buying	at	attractive	prices.	As	you
might	 suspect,	 you	 should	 sell	 your	 stock	 if	 you	 can	 place	 your	 money	 in
another,	more	profitable,	investment.	It	is	as	simple	as	that!	It	is	great	if	you
expect	your	favorite	stock	to	increase	by	8%	a	year,	but	if	you	can	find	another
investment	that	yields	9%,	why	not	pick	the	winner?	Although	the	decision	to
switch	 assets	 might	 seem	 simple	 and	 straightforward,	 one	 must	 consider	 the
costs	 associated	 with	 switching	 assets	 before	 making	 that	 decision.	 On
BuffettsBooks.com,	we	have	provided	a	sell	calculator	and	video	to	help	you
through	the	process	of	accounting	for	capital	gains	and	growth	projections.	The
calculator	can	be	found	at	the	following	Web	address:

[http://www.buffettsbooks.com/security-analysis/when-to-sell-shares.html](http://www.buffettsbooks.com/security-analysis/when-to-sell-shares.html)

In	 conjunction	 with	 the	 sell	 calculator,	 you’ll	 also	 need	 to	 access	 one	 of	 the
intrinsic	value	calculators	to	get	the	yield	projections.	In	order	to	facilitate	your
decision	and	use	of	the	online	calculators,	an	outline	is	provided	below	to	assist
in	the	thought	process	and	methodology.

To	decide	if	you	should	keep	or	sell	your	current	holding	(stock	A),	or	invest	in
another	(stock	B),	follow	these	four	easy	steps:

```
Calculate	the	expected	annual	return	for	stocks	A	and	B	based	on	the
current	market	prices
Subtract	the	cost	of	capital	gains	tax	from	stock	A
Calculate	whether	stock	A	or	B	yields	the	highest	expected	annual	return
based	on	a	given	timeframe.
```
Let’s	look	at	each	of	the	steps	in	detail.

```
1)	Calculate	the	expected	annual	return	for	stocks	A	and	B	based	on	the
current	market	prices
As	you	will	recall,	the	intrinsic	value	calculation	was	adjusted	to	account	for
the	 return	 you	 could	 expect	 at	 a	 given	 market	 price.	 Depending	 on	 which
intrinsic	value	model	you	use,	you’ll	either	apply	the	trial-and-error	approach
with	the	BuffettsBooks	intrinsic	value	calculator	or	you	can	simply	input	the
current	market	price	(last	input)	for	the	DCF	calculator.	Either	way,	you	need
to	determine	the	appropriate	discount	rate	that	makes	the	intrinsic	value	equal
to	the	current	market	price.	You’ll	need	to	do	this	for	both	stocks:	once	for
your	current	holding	and	once	when	you	evaluate	the	new	pick.	Imagine	in
```

```
this	 example	 that,	 after	 determining	 that	 discount	 rate	 for	 each	 pick,	 the
expected	annual	return	is	6%	for	stock	A	and	9%	for	stock	B.	If	you	have
difficulty	determining	these	expected	annual	returns,	you	can	reference	the
video	that’s	located	on	the	same	Web	page	as	the	sell	calculator.
2)	Subtract	the	cost	of	capital	gains	tax	from	stock	A
In	Principle	2,	Rule	2	we	looked	at	the	different	capital	gains	that	must	be
paid	if	you	sell	a	stock	with	profit.	Let’s	have	a	quick	review:

$9,076	to	$36,900 15% 0%
$36,901	to	$89,350 25% 15%
$89,351	to	$186,350 28% 15%
$186,351	to	$405,100 33% 15%
$405,101	to	$406,750 35% 15%
More	than	$406,750 39.6% 20%
```
Short-term	capital	gain	<	1	year

Let	 us	 say	 that	 you	 have	 held	 stock	 A	 for	 less	 than	 a	 year	 and	 your	 annual
income	tax	bracket	is	$100,000.	As	a	result,	your	capital	gains	tax	would	be
28%.	 Imagine	 that	 you	 initially	 purchased	 stock	 A	 for	 $60	 and	 it	 has	 now
increased	to	$100.	In	this	case,	you	would	have	to	pay	$11.20	($40*28%)	in
taxes	 per	 share	 and	 you	 would	 have	 a	 total	 of	 $88.80	 ($100-$11.20)	 left	 for
investing	into	stock	B.

Remember	it	is	only	the	profit	that	you	are	paying	capital	gains	taxes	on	($100-
$60),	not	the	full	amount.

```
3)	Calculate	whether	stocks	A	or	B	yield	the	highest	expected	annual
return	based	on	a	given	timeframe.
```

```
Current	Stock New	Stock
0 $100 $89
5 $154 $143
```
10 $237 $231

15 $364 $372

20 $560 $599

25 $862 $964

30 $1,327 $1,553


Above,	you	can	see	a	screen	capture	for	the	inputs	we	have	described	on	the	sell
calculator	at	BuffettsBooks.com.	Noteworthy	highlights	are	the	amount	of	time
it	takes	(almost	15	years)	for	the	investor	to	recuperate	their	capital	gains	loss
when	switching	assets.	Although	the	investor	eventually	makes	more	money	by
switching	into	a	higher	yielding	asset,	the	time	associated	with	that	recovery	is
the	part	that	needs	to	be	considered.	This	is	the	whole	purpose	of	using	the	sell
calculator—to	 determine	 how	 long	 will	 it	 take	 an	 investor	 to	 recover	 the
principal	 that	 was	 lost	 due	 to	 frictional	 costs	 (i.e.,	 taxes).	 As	 you	 change	 the
variables	in	the	calculator,	you’ll	quickly	find	that	the	inputs	for	capital	gains
and	 growth	 rates	 will	 drastically	 change	 the	 timeframe	 for	 recovering	 tax
expenses.

**Summing	up:	Buy	at	attractive	prices**

```
Margin	of	safety	is	the	difference	between	the	intrinsic	value	and	the
```

```
Margin	of	safety	is	the	difference	between	the	intrinsic	value	and	the
current	share	price.	You	want	as	much	margin	as	possible	to	minimize
risk.
A	price/earnings	ratio	below	15	is	a	rule	of	thumb	and	starting	point	to
finding	decently	priced	stocks.	The	lower	the	price/earnings	ratio,	the
less	you	have	to	pay	for	$1	of	earnings.
A	price/book	value	below	1.5	is	a	rule	of	thumb	and	starting	point	for
reducing	your	exposure	to	risk.	A	key	ratio	of	1	means	that	the	investor
pays	$1	of	price	for	every	$1	of	equity	in	the	company.	If	a	company
has	a	high	price/book	ratio,	you	can	minimize	your	risk	if	the	company
has	a	very	large	moat	(i.e.,	a	valuable	brand	and/or	patent).
A	treasury	bond	can	be	used	as	a	ruler,	or	benchmark,	for	quantifying	the
value	of	stocks.	Specifically,	it	can	be	used	as	a	discount	rate	so	stocks
can	be	priced	in	a	manner	that’s	compared	to	a	zero	risk	investment.	By
making	this	comparison,	you’ll	protect	yourself	in	a	high-interest
environment,	because	stocks	will	become	less	attractive,	whereas	in	a
low-interest	environment	stocks	become	more	valuable.	Buffett	uses	the
10-year	federal	note	as	a	starting	point.
The	discount	cash	flow	(DCF)	calculator	is	a	model	that	calculates	a
company’s	intrinsic	value.	This	model	uses	the	free	cash	flow	of	a
company	and	sums	its	expected	growth	into	eternity	(or	perpetuity).	All
those	cash	flows	are	then	discounted	back	to	today’s	value	in	order	to
determine	a	corresponding	intrinsic	value.
The	BuffettsBooks	Intrinsic	Value	Calculator	is	similar	to	the	DCF	model
but	it	sums	cash	flows	into	a	finite	period	(i.e.,	ten	years).	Additionally,
the	BuffettsBooks	calculator	uses	per	share	numbers	to	estimate	cash
flow	from	dividends	and	book	value	growth.	To	apply	the	model,	a
stock	must	fulfill	all	four	principles.
A	stock	should	be	sold	if	the	company	is	breaking	one	or	more	of	Warren
Buffett’s	principles,	if	it	takes	up	too	much	of	your	portfolio,	or	if	you
can	get	a	better	return	from	another	investment.

# Chapter	5	

## Financial	Statements	and	the	Stock	Investor

```
“Accounting	is	the	language	of	business.” —Warren	Buffett
```
Just	as	you	should	learn	the	local	language	if	you	want	to	integrate	into	a	foreign
country,	 you	 will	 be	 lost	 in	 value	 investing	 if	 you	 cannot	 read	 financial
statements.

In	 Chapter	 3,	 I	 briefly	 introduced	 the	 three	 main	 financial	 statements.	 The
purpose	was	to	provide	you	with	a	basic	understanding	of	accounting	so	you
could	identify	and	apply	Warren	Buffett’s	four	principles.	In	this	chapter,	I	will
not	only	give	you	an	insight	into	why	accounting	is	relevant,	but	I	will	deep-dive
into	the	composition	of	each	line	in	the	three	financial	statements.

Let’s	get	started...

##### Why	are	financial	statements	important	to	the	stock	investor?

You	 are	 probably	 well	 aware	 that	 investors	 eagerly	 wait	 for	 the	 company’s
annual	and	quarterly	reports	in	order	to	gauge	the	value	of	their	investments.	As
you’ve	already	started	to	learn,	the	value	of	a	business	is	entirely	dependent	on
how	these	numbers	move	and	are	expected	to	move	into	the	future.	But	before
we	go	further	down	the	path	of	detailed	accounting,	there	are	a	few	items	that
need	to	be	presented.

Imagine	that	the	Disney	Company	had	1,000	shares	outstanding.	If	that	were	the
case,	 potentially	 there	 could	 be	 1,000	 company	 owners.	 Understanding	 this
fundamental	 concept,	 we	 can	 now	 introduce	 the	 idea	 of	 a	 board	 of	 directors
(BOD).	Since	most	businesses	are	divided	into	much	more	than	1,000	shares,	the
number	of	owners	is	typically	in	the	thousands	or	millions.	With	so	many	people
owning	a	share	of	the	business,	a	BOD	is	a	governing	body	that	represents	the
voice	of	all	those	owners.

This	is	often	referred	to	as	the	principal-agent	discussion,	and	if	that	rings	a	bell
it	 is	 because	 I	 previously	 introduced	 this	 in	 Chapter	 4.	 The	 agent-principle


relationship	is	probably	the	major	reason	financial	statements	are	so	important.
Investors	 can	 analyze	 the	 information	 presented	 in	 the	 annual	 accounts	 and
investigate	the	inner	workings	of	the	organization.	The	annual	accounts	are	the
most	important	form	of	communication	between	the	BOD	and	the	shareholders.
As	 this	 information	 is	 distributed	 to	 all	 the	 shareholders,	 thousands	 of	 eyes
should	 theoretically	 be	 reviewing	 the	 authenticity	 of	 the	 company’s
performance.

Generally,	you	will	find	that	most	publically	traded	businesses	have	an	“Investor
Relations”	 section	 in	 their	 website.	 Here	 you	 should	 find	 the	 recent	 reports,
dividend	 history,	 video/audio	 conference	 calls	 about	 the	 previous	 quarter’s
report.	The	more	information	you	find	in	this	investor	relations	area,	the	better.
As	 an	 investor,	 I	 always	 like	 to	 see	 a	 thorough	 investor	 relation’s	 hub	 for
information.	 Without	 a	 firm	 understanding	 of	 the	 language	 of	 business,	 or
accounting,	the	message	being	conveyed	to	all	the	owners	will	be	missed.

##### Accounting	basics	at	a	glance

Now	 let’s	 look	 at	 the	 very	 basics	 of	 accounting.	 By	 the	 time	 you	 study	 the
annual	report,	a	lot	of	work	has	already	been	done	by	the	accountants.	Every
accountant	knows	the	world	of	debits	and	credits,	but	as	an	investor	you	might
not	understand	the	“plumbing”	of	how	all	the	money	moves	between	each	of	the
financial	statements	and	subsequent	accounts.

**The	world	of	debits	and	credits**

“Every	debit	must	have	a	credit.”	This	mantra	forms	the	basis	of	all	accounting
concepts	and	standards	developed	to	date.	The	system	of	debits	and	credits	is
known	as	the	double-entry	system.	As	the	name	implies,	every	entry	has	a	dual
impact	on	the	financial	accounts.	To	take	a	simple	example,	when	a	person	buys
a	product,	what	is	the	impact	of	that	action?	The	purchase	results	in	an	outflow
of	cash	while	the	inflow	is	in	the	form	of	a	product	or	service.

Now	let’s	apply	this	principle	to	a	corporation.	When	a	company	purchases	raw
materials	with	cash	from	its	corporate	bank	account,	the	outflow	would	be	in	the
form	of	cash,	whereas	the	inflow	is	in	the	form	of	raw	materials	to	make	their
products.	Dual	impact	once	again.

A	company	organizes	all	their	financial	data	into	records	called	accounts.	This
organization	is	referred	to	as	the	“chart	of	accounts.”	If	a	business	is	very	large
and	has	many	moving	divisions,	the	chart	of	accounts	can	become	extremely
large	 and	 cumbersome.	 Luckily	 for	 us,	 all	 these	 accounts	 are	 outlined	 and


summarized	in	the	income	statement	and	balance	sheet.	So	if	you	crack	open
those	two	financial	statements,	they	provide	the	foundation	for	all	the	different
accounts	 a	 business	 might	 have.	 As	 you	 probably	 recall	 from	 Chapter	 3,	 I
introduced	the	following:

The	Income	Statement:

```
Revenues
Expenses
```
The	Balance	Sheet:

```
Assets
Liabilities
Equity
```
Now,	as	we	move	forward	and	briefly	discuss	a	few	examples	of	how	double-
entry	accounting	works,	please	don’t	get	discouraged.	There’s	no	way	a	person
seeing	 this	 for	 the	 first	 time	 is	 going	 to	 holistically	 understand	 all	 the
terminology	and	application.	The	reason	it’s	being	explained	is	to	provide	you
with	a	general	understanding	of	the	financial	statements	and	what	has	happened
before	you	read	them.

If	 you	 have	 had	 a	 brief	 encounter	 with	 accounting	 before,	 you	 might	 benefit
from	 the	 chart	 below.	 This	 chart	 characterizes	 the	 proper	 terminology	 for
whether	an	account	is	being	debited	or	credited.	For	example,	if	a	revenue	is
added	to	the	income	statement,	that’s	referred	to	as	a	credit.

```
The	Income	Statement: Debit Credit
Revenues	(or	Income) Decrease Increase
Expenses Increase Decrease
```
```
The	Balance	Sheet: Debit Credit
Assets Increase Decrease
Liabilities Decrease Increase
Owner’s	Equity Decrease Increase
```
Let’s	start	with	a	T-account.	A	T-account	is	nothing	more	than	a	“T”	diagram
with	debits	listed	on	the	left	and	credits	listed	on	the	right.	This	is	important:
debits	are	always	on	the	left	and	credits	are	always	on	the	right.	This	is	what	a	T-


account	looks	like:

Looks	simple	enough,	doesn’t	it?	So	let’s	try	it	out	with	an	example.	Let’s	say	a
company	wants	to	borrow	$10,000	from	the	bank	on	January	1st.	As	a	result	of
the	loan,	the	company’s	cash	on	hand	increases	by	$10,000.	Before	we	simply
add	that	into	the	T-account,	we	must	also	consider	the	doubly	entry.	It	is	not
enough	that	we	just	make	a	journal	entry	of	$10,000	to	our	company.	Someone
obviously	 wants	 the	 money	 back	 if	 we	 have	 borrowed	 it,	 and	 that	 must	 be
reflected	in	the	double-entry.

In	this	case,	we	would	call	that	account	the _	notes	payable	_ and	increase	it	by
$10,000.	Notes	payable	is	a	fancy	accounting	term	that	means	“loans	that	need
to	be	paid.”	So	if	we	were	going	to	mark	this	double-entry	into	our	T-accounts,	it
would	look	something	like	this:


Try	 to	 stop	 for	 a	 moment	 and	 think	 about	 the	 mechanics	 behind	 what	 just
happened.	We	now	own	$10,000	that	we	did	not	have	before.	Types	of	assets
could	 be	 buildings,	 cars,	 or,	 as	 in	 this	 situation,	 cash.	 To	 increase	 our	 cash
holding,	we	therefore	debit	the	asset	column.

On	the	other	hand,	it	is	money	that	we	have	borrowed	from	a	bank.	So	before	we
can	go	out	and	spend	it,	we	also	want	our	accounts	to	reflect	what	we	need	to
pay	 back.	 We	 therefore	 credit	 a	 similar	 amount	 of	 $10,000,	 increasing	 the
liabilities	column	under	Notes	Payable.


Hopefully,	 this	 seems	 fairly	 easy	 and	 straightforward.	 Let’s	 try	 a	 follow-on
example.	Let’s	assume	that	we	move	forward	six	days	and	we	now	want	to	make
a	 payment	 on	 our	 outstanding	 loan—or	 Notes	 Payable	 account.	 Let’s	 say	 we
take	$1,000	in	cash	and	make	a	payment	on	the	loan.	What	would	our	T-account
look	like	then?

The	idea	behind	this	is	actually	quite	simple.	We	would	now	only	have	$9,000	in
cash,	but	on	the	contrary	we	would	only	have	borrowed	a	total	of	$9,000	from
the	bank.	You	probably	see	now	why	this	is	called	double-entry	accounting.

Although	 double-entry	 accounting	 can	 get	 quite	 complex,	 don’t	 be	 worried.


Your	head	should	not	be	spinning	about	the	terminology	of	debits	and	credits	on
T	accounts.	As	a	successful	stock	market	investor,	your	job	is	to	focus	on	the	big
picture.	 Although	 double-entry	 accounting	 is	 the	 foundation	 for	 financial
statements,	you’ll	probably	never	have	to	see	another	T-account	diagram	ever
again.	The	important	point	is	this:	If	money	listed	on	a	financial	statement	gets
bigger	or	smaller	from	one	reporting	period	to	the	next,	we	know	the	money
went	somewhere!

The	investigation	into	where	the	money	went	is	the	part	that	makes	you	a	smart
and	successful	investor.	This	investigation	is	the	goal	for	the	rest	of	the	book;	for
example,	you	might	see	a	company’s	cash	account	really	grow	from	one	year	to
the	next.	An	amateur	investor	would	simply	stop	there	and	say	that’s	a	great
thing.

The	serious	stock	investor,	however,	will	go	straight	to	the	cash	flow	statement
and	 see	 where	 the	 cash	 came	 from.	 If	 the	 cash	 came	 from	 a	 loan,	 is	 that
something	to	get	excited	about?	Of	course	not!	What	if	the	cash	came	from	the
net	income?	Well	if	that’s	the	case,	that’s	a	great	thing	for	the	stock	investor.
Tracking	how	the	money	flows	through	a	business	is	like	watching	a	plumber
determine	where	the	leak	is	in	a	house.	He	starts	at	the	source,	where	the	water
enters	the	main	valve	into	the	house	(the	net	income),	and	he	ends	at	the	sink
(the	growing/decreasing	equity	and/or	dividend).	A	well-managed	and	profitable
business	will	show	a	strong	flow	of	cash	through	the	plumbing	of	the	accounts.

**Cash-based	accounting**

The	first	accounting	regime	you	should	know	about	is	cash-based	accounting,
and	 the	 second	 is	 accrual	 accounting.	 As	 an	 intelligent	 stock	 investor,	 you’ll
definitely	 want	 to	 become	 familiar	 with	 the	 latter—accrual	 accounting.	 Since
publically	traded	companies	are	forced	to	use	accrual	accounting,	that	is	what
we’ll	primarily	be	discussing	throughout	the	remainder	of	the	book.

Before	 moving	 to	 accrual	 accounting,	 let’s	 start	 with	 the	 easy	 concepts	 first.
Cash-based	accounting	is	essentially	what	the	name	says:	accounting	based	on
cash.	A	transaction	is	recorded	only	when	cash	is	physically	or	digitally	received
into	the	bank	account.	It	sounds	easy	enough,	doesn’t	it?	It	really	is.	Most	people
live	their	lives	on	a	cash	basis,	so	the	subject	should	be	familiar;	for	example,	if
you	buy	a	cup	of	coffee	at	a	Starbucks,	you	receive	your	coffee	right	after	the
cash	leaves	your	pocket.	This	is	cash-based	accounting.

Now,	very	often	in	business	the	transfer	of	goods	and	services	will	not	happen


simultaneously	 with	 the	 cash	 payment.	 Consider	 a	 company	 working	 on	 a
project	 that	 gets	 completed	 before	 the	 year’s	 end.	 Payment	 for	 the	 project,
however,	is	received	at	the	beginning	of	the	following	year.	If	the	company	is
following	 cash-based	 accounting,	 the	 transaction	 would	 be	 recorded	 in	 the
second	year	because	the	cash	didn’t	arrive	in	the	account	until	then.	This	is	the
fundamental	 principle	 underlying	 cash-based	 accounting:	 transactions	 are
recorded	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 inflow	 or	 outflow	 of	 cash	 when	 the	 money	 actually
changes	accounts,	not	when	the	service	or	product	is	provided	or	received.

This	form	of	accounting	is	useful	for	small	businesses	that	operate	on	a	cash
basis.	 Although	 this	 might	 be	 alright	 for	 “mom	 and	 pop”-style	 businesses,
accounting	 laws	 do	 not	 allow	 for	 larger	 companies	 to	 conduct	 cash-based
accounting.	The	reason	for	this	is	because	it	represents	a	slow	and	delayed	way
of	tracking	revenues	and	expenses.	This	is	where	 _accrual	accounting	_ comes	in.

**Accrual	accounting**

Accrual	 accounting	 simply	 states	 that	 expenditures	 must	 be	 recorded	 when
incurred	and	not	when	paid.	Similarly,	revenue	must	be	recorded	when	there	is
an	outflow	of	services	or	goods,	not	when	the	payment	is	realized.	Let’s	make
this	really	simple	to	understand.	Let’s	say	you’re	trying	to	start	a	new	business
and	your	product	is	the	world’s	best	beach	ball.	In	order	to	get	your	product	into
as	many	stores	as	possible,	you	provide	a	sample	to	Wal-Mart.

After	Wal-Mart	looks	at	your	beach	ball,	they	decide	to	give	you	a	purchase
order	of	10,000	units.	Part	of	the	deal	on	the	purchase	order	is	that	payment	will
be	made	in	 _NET	90	days._ 	This	means	that,	after	you	provide	the	product,	Wal-
Mart	 has	 90	 days	 to	 pay	 you	 for	 all	 those	 beach	 balls.	 According	 to	 accrual
accounting,	even	though	you	won’t	receive	money	from	Wal-Mart	for	90	days,
you	would	still	list	this	sale	on	the	financial	books	today.

The	important	part	to	understand	at	this	point	is	that	the	payment	hasn’t	occurred
yet.	In	fact,	the	payment	won’t	be	made	for	another	90	days.

When	you	are	analyzing	financial	statements,	namely	the	income	statement	and
balance	sheet,	always	remember	that	the	publicly	traded	companies	are	based	on
accrual	accounting.	As	a	result,	you	will	have	a	more	current	and	candid	picture
of	 the	 company’s	 performance.	 Now,	 with	 every	 positive	 comes	 a	 negative:
although	accrual	accounting	provides	a	higher	level	of	fidelity	and	timeliness,
many	critics	say	it	fails	to	show	the	actual	cash	flow.

Let’s	go	back	to	the	Wal-Mart	example.	Although	we	have	listed	the	sale	in	our


financial	 statements,	 there	 is	 nothing	 preventing	 Wal-Mart	 from	 potentially
defaulting	on	the	payment.	Now,	Wal-Mart	is	probably	a	bad	example	for	this
scenario,	 but	 the	 idea	 of	 a	 payment	 not	 being	 made	 is	 very	 important	 and
applicable	in	some	cases.	Like	people,	many	businesses	can	go	bankrupt.	If	this
is	 the	 case,	 the	 numbers	 being	 reported	 may	 not	 actually	 materialize	 into	 the
account.

Before	you	get	scared	and	look	at	accrual	accounting	as	a	corrupt	way	of	doing
business,	let	me	reintroduce	the	purpose	of	the	cash	flow	statement—which	was
first	 described	 in	 Chapter	 3.	 So	 far,	 we’ve	 only	 talked	 about	 the	 income
statement	and	balance	sheet,	but	as	you’ll	see,	the	cash	flow	statement	helps	add
clarity	to	the	fog	of	accrual	accounting.

Prior	to	1987,	companies	only	reported	their	financial	information	on	the	income
statement	 and	 balance	 sheet.	 Unfortunately	 for	 investors,	 this	 made	 it	 very
difficult	to	determine	certain	things;	for	example,	on	a	balance	sheet,	investors
could	see	that	a	company	might	have	increased	the	size	of	their	buildings	or
equipment,	but	where	did	the	money	come	from	that	paid	for	this?	Also,	if	you
looked	at	the	bottom	line	of	the	income	statement,	an	investor	would	see	the	net
income.	This	is	nice	to	know,	but	how	much	of	that	income	was	actually	turned
into	cash	for	the	business	to	use?	In	order	to	fix	this	problem	and	provide	owners
and	investors	a	more	comprehensive	look	at	the	businesses	accounting,	it	was
decided	that	companies	should	adopt	cash	flow	statements	in	their	reporting.

**A	short	recap**

Here’s	a	recap	for	those	feeling	overwhelmed.	The	accounting	system	is	based
on	double	entries.	For	every	debit,	there	must	be	a	credit.	Each	entry	within	the
accounting	system	has	a	dual	impact,	making	it	possible	to	balance...	a	balance
sheet.	The	debits	and	credits	might	be	based	on	cash	inflows	and	outflows	or	on
product	and	service	inflows	and	outflows.	The	cash-based	accounting	system	is
subject	to	much	criticism,	and	in	order	to	provide	a	true	and	fair	view,	standards
require	 that	 publicly	 traded	 companies	 incorporate	 the	 accrual	 accounting
system.	 Although	 accrual	 accounting	 might	 count	 funds	 that	 haven’t	 actually
been	 paid,	 it	 provides	 a	 clearer	 and	 realistic	 picture	 of	 the	 company’s
performance—especially	 for	 stock	 investors.	 A	 great	 way	 to	 account	 for	 any
inconsistencies	caused	from	accrual	accounting	is	by	thoroughly	understanding
the	cash	flow	statement.

## Income	Statement	in	Detail

Do	 you	 remember	 Warren	 Buffett’s	 statement	 about	 accounting	 being	 the
language	of	business?	Well,	with	that	in	mind,	you	should	consider	the	following
chapters	as	learning	the	finer	points	of	grammar	in	a	new	language.	When	you
visit	a	foreign	country,	you’ll	do	fine	with	the	most	common	phrases;	but	if	you
_really_ want	 to	 master	 another	 language,	 you	 need	 to	 learn	 the	 fine	 grammar
_while_ 	you	speak	the	language.	Let’s	start	by	diving	into	the	income	statement.


## Introduction	to	the	income	statement

As	you	have	probably	already	realized,	in	investing	and	accounting	we	have	a	lot
of	 words	 for	 the	 same	 thing.	 This	 is	 true	 for	 the	 income	 statement,	 which	 is
referred	to	as	the	profit	and	loss	statement,	the	statement	of	operations,	and	the
statement	of	income.	Regardless	of	all	these	names	(which	I’m	convinced	are
used	 to	 confuse	 people),	 the	 income	 statement’s	 sole	 purpose	 is	 to	 show	 a
company’s	profitability	over	a	given	period	of	time.

As	I	have	said	many	times,	financial	statements	are	really	easy	to	understand,
and	the	income	statement	is	no	different.	Still,	one	reason	so	few	understand
them	 is	 because	 income	 statements	 always	 look	 different.	 Yes,	 that’s	 right!
Income	 statements	 always	 seem	 to	 have	 different	 lines	 and	 the	 names	 of	 the
accounts	 can	 change	 depending	 on	 which	 company	 you	 are	 looking	 at;	 for
example,	 one	 company	 might	 call	 _revenue,_ “ _turnover”_ and	 another	 company
may	seem	to	forget	to	include	 _depreciation_ ,	while	a	competitor	has	disclosed	it
as	a	major	expense.

Don’t	be	confused	by	all	of	this.	All	income	statements	are	essentially	built	the
same	way.	Let	me	give	you	an	example:

```
Annual	(year	2014)	Income	statement in	millions
1 Revenue 13,279
2 Cost	of	revenue 5,348
1-2	=	3 Gross	Margin 7,931
```
```
4 Sales	and	Marketing	expenses 1,105
5 Research	and	development	expenses 863
6 General	and	Administration	expenses 538
7 Other	operating	expenses 1,350
4+5+6+7	=	8 Operating	expenses 3,856
```
```
3-8	=	9 Income	from	operations 4,075
```

```
10 Net	interest	income/(expenses) (135)
11 Extraordinary	income/(expenses) 275
12 Income	taxes 1,352
9+10+11-12	=	13 Net	income 2,863
```
You	were	introduced	to	this	income	statement	in	Chapter	3.	As	we	move	through
this	chapter,	I	will	break	down	each	line	separately	to	enable	a	full	understanding
of	the	income	statement.	Let’s	start	learning	about	this	statement	by	looking	at
the	very	top.	The	first	thing	you	should	notice	is	the	term,	or	duration,	of	the
statement.	This	particular	example	says	we	are	looking	at	an	annual	statement
for	2014.	The	income	statement	will	typically	be	an	annual	or	quarterly	report.
Next,	 look	 at	 the	 first	 (1)	 and	 last	 line	 (13).	 These	 two	 lines	 are	 the	 most
important	items	on	the	statement.	Think	of	Revenue	as	all	the	sales	the	company
makes,	 and	 Net	 Income	 as	 the	 “bottom	 line”	 profit	 those	 sales	 produced;	 for
example,	Coca-Cola	might	sell	a	2-liter	bottle	for	$2.00	(line	1—Revenue),	but
the	profit	for	that	sale	might	be	$0.20	(line	13—Net	Income).	Now	for	the	easy
part:	all	the	numbers	in	between	the	first	and	last	line	are	the	expenses	and/or
credits	 that	 brought	 the	 revenue	 from	 $2.00	 to	 a	 profit	 line	 of	 $0.20.	 In	 the
statement	above,	you	can	see	that	the	overall	revenue	is	$13,279.	That	revenue
produced	a	profit	(or	net	income)	of	$2,863.

**The	difference	between	revenue	and	gain**

So	what	do	the	different	lines	in	the	income	statement	mean	and	how	are	they
important?	To	answer	this	question,	I’ll	break	it	down	into	steps.	First,	however,
let’s	look	at	an	outline	of	the	key	components	of	the	income	statement:


## 1.	Revenues	and	gains

```
a.	Revenues	generated	from	primary	activities
b.	Revenues	generated	from	secondary	activities
c.	Gains.
```

## 2.	Expenses	and	losses

```
a.	Expenses	generated	from	primary	activities
b.	Expenses	generated	from	secondary	activities
c.	Expenses	generated	from	financial	activities
d.	Losses.
```
As	we	look	at	this	list,	you	can	see	all	the	items	under	row	1	involve	a	positive
cash	flow,	while	items	under	row	2	involve	a	negative	cash	flow.	The	difference
between	these	two	rows	is	the	bottom	line	of	the	income	statement,	which	is	the
net	income	or	net	loss.

Let’s	start	by	discussing	the	revenues	and	gains.	This	is	the	part	every	investor
should	enjoy—the	topic	of	earning	money	for	the	company.	As	we	look	at	the
three	 categories	 (primary	 activities,	 secondary	 activities	 and	 gains),	 each	 one
adds	a	different	type	of	positive	cash	flow	to	the	income	statement.	Remember,
the	income	statement	is	cumulative	for	a	specified	period	of	time.	If	you	sold
one	bottle	of	your	$1	soft	drinks	every	day	for	three	months,	your	revenues	on
the	quarterly	income	statement	would	be	$90.	Easy	enough.

As	you	might	expect,	many	million-and	billion-dollar	businesses	have	numerous
ways	to	make	money.	Sticking	with	our	example,	they	might	not	only	sell	soda,
but	they	might	also	receive	revenues	from	other	investments	or	loans	they’ve
made.	All	of	this	positive	revenue	is	recorded	on	the	income	statement,	but	it’s
categorized	 differently.	 The	 following	 are	 the	 differences	 between	 the	 three
types	of	revenues/gains:

**1.a.	Revenues	from	primary	activities** :	 This	 is	 probably	 the	 easiest	 type	 of
revenue	for	new	investors	to	understand.	Simply	put,	it’s	the	revenue	received
for	the	sale	of	the	company’s	primary	product	or	service.	Going	back	to	our	soft
drinks	example,	all	of	the	revenue	logged	on	the	income	statement	for	the	sale	of
soft	drinks	would	be	considered	revenue	from	primary	activities,	or	operating
revenues.	In	this	example,	the	company	has	a	primary	revenue	of	$13,279	(line
1).

**1.b.	 Revenues	 from	 secondary	 activities** :	 As	 I	 mentioned	 earlier,	 not	 all
revenue	comes	from	the	sale	of	a	primary	product	or	service;	for	example,	let’s
say	that	your	soft	drinks	business	has	$1,000	cash	on	hand	in	a	savings	account


from	previous	sales.	During	the	three	months	of	selling	soft	drinks,	the	$1,000	of
cash	sitting	in	an	interest-bearing	savings	account	produced	revenue	of	$2.50
from	1%	annual	interest.

In	an	effort	to	properly	account	for	all	of	the	company’s	revenues,	secondary
activities	are	usually	included	in	an	income	statement	under	the	line	titled	 _net
interest	income._ 	It	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	 _other	income	_ if	it	also	includes
other	revenues	not	made	from	financial	activities.	You	should	not	be	too	focused
on	what	the	line	is	called,	but	simply	be	aware	that	other	forms	of	revenue	exist_._

In	the	numbered	income	statement	shown	above,	we	can	see	that	there	is	a	$135
deficit.	This	means	that	in	the	previous	year,	there	have	been	higher	expenses	for
financial	activities	than	for	secondary	revenue.	We	will	return	to	this	in	section
2.c	to	explain	further.

**1.c.	Gains** :	 Let’s	 assume	 that	 the	 soft	 drinks	 company	 you	 own	 has	 a	 really
awesome	 location.	 When	 you	 purchased	 this	 location	 five	 years	 ago,	 you
purchased	it	for	$1,000.	Although	the	location	is	really	good,	you	want	to	move
to	a	bigger	and	more	spacious	building.	As	a	result,	you	need	to	sell	the	old	land.
When	you	put	the	land	on	the	market,	you’re	very	excited	to	find	that	you’re
able	to	sell	it	for	$1,500.	That’s	a	$500	gain.	From	time	to	time,	you’ll	see	gains
listed	 on	 the	 income	 statement	 as	 “Gain	 (Loss)	 on	 Sale	 of	 Assets.”	 It’s	 very
important	to	understand	that	gains	are	not	considered	operating	income.	That	is
also	why	gains	and	losses	are	sometimes	referred	to	as	 _extraordinary	income
(expense)_.

For	simplicity	in	our	generic	income	statement,	I	only	use	a	single	line	to	capture
the	difference	between	all	extraordinary	income	and	expenses.	In	this	example,	it
is	$275,	which	is	a	positive	number	and	therefore	a	gain.

```
Annual	(year	2014)	Income	statement in	millions
```
```
1 Revenue 13,279
```
```
1a)	Revenue	from	primary
activities
2 Cost	of	revenue 5,348
1-2	=	3 Gross	margin 7,931
```
```
4 Sales	and	marketing	expenses 1,105
```
```
5 Research	and	development	expenses 863
```

```
6 General	and	administration	expenses 538
7 Other	operating	expenses 1,350
4+5+6+7	=	8 Operating	expenses 3,856
```
```
3-8	=	9 Income	from	operations 4,075
```
```
10 Net	interest	income/(expenses) (135)
```
```
1b)	Revenue	from	secondary
activities
```
```
11 Extraordinary	income/(expenses) 275 1c)	Gains
12 Income	taxes 1,352
9+10+11-12	=	13 Net	income 2,863
```
So,	that’s	it	for	the	positive	numbers	being	listed	on	the	income	statement.	Just
like	the	revenues	and	gains,	the	negative	numbers	have	very	similar	categories.

**The	difference	between	expenses	and	losses**

**2.a.	Expenses	generated	from	primary	activities** :	 I	 expect	 you	 are	 already
anticipating	this,	but	expenses	from	primary	activities	are	only	those	expenses
that	 occur	 from	 producing	 operating	 revenues;	 for	 example,	 if	 our	 primary
revenue	involves	selling	soft	drinks,	our	primary	expenses	would	involve	buying
sugar	 and	 tin	 for	 the	 cans.	 For	 our	 company,	 we	 have	 primary	 expenses	 of
$5,348.	This	is	listed	on	the	income	statement	as	“Cost	of	Revenue”	(line	2).

**2.b.	Expenses	generated	from	secondary	activities** :	If	an	expense	is	made	by
the	business	and	it	doesn’t	directly	relate	to	the	materials	or	labor	used	to	make
the	 primary	 product,	 it’s	 considered	 an	 expense	 generated	 from	 secondary
activities.	You’ll	often	find	these	expenses	listed	on	the	income	statement	after
the	primary	activity	expenses.	Secondary	activity	expenses	look	like	this	on	the
income	statement:

```
Sales	and	marketing	expenses
Research	and	development	expenses
General	and	administrative	expenses
Other	operating	expenses
```
Keep	in	mind	that	you	will	often	find	other	terms	for	secondary	expenses	that	are
not	 mentioned	 above.	 Either	 way,	 remember	 that	 a	 company	 cannot	 omit
reporting	 expenses.	 It	 is	 simply	 a	 question	 of	 how	 the	 company	 chooses	 to


disclose	 it.	 For	 instance,	 take	 an	 expense	 like	 depreciation	 on	 the	 company’s
cars.	The	company	can	choose	to	disclose	depreciation	on	a	single	line,	as	seen
above,	or	to	allocate	the	depreciation	on	the	specific	cars	to	the	departments	to
which	 the	 cars	 belong.	 That	 means	 that	 some	 depreciation	 expenses	 will	 be
allocated	 to	 Sales	 and	 Marketing,	 while	 other	 expenses	 will	 be	 allocated	 to
Research	and	Development,	and	so	on.

In	 the	 example,	 there	 are	 expenses	 from	 secondary	 activities,	 or	 operating
expenses	of	$3,856	(line	8).

**2.c.	 Expenses	 from	 financial	 activities:	** On	 the	 face	 of	 it,	 expenses	 from
financial	activities	may	look	as	if	they	should	be	clustered	with	the	expenses
from	secondary	activities.	After	all,	they	are	expenses	originating	from	borrowed
money,	and	those	same	loans	keep	the	business	running.

Although	that	might	make	intuitive	sense,	we	disclose	this	separately	as	 _interest
expenses_ ,	as	they	are	not	part	of	the	daily	business.	This	is	made	clearer	when
we	look	at	line	number	10,	which	is	presented	away	from	the	operations.	In	the
case	of	our	example	company,	it’s	expenses	from	financial	activities	of	$135.
Since	 this	 account	 is	 combined	 with	 the	 secondary	 revenues,	 which	 were
discussed	in	section	1.b.,	we	now	see	that	the	company	owed	more	interest	to
banks	or	lenders	than	the	company	received	in	interest	payments	from	bonds	or
other	securities.

**2.d.	Losses:** 	Understanding	how	a	loss	is	recorded	is	fairly	straightforward.	A
loss	doesn’t	relate	directly	to	the	primary	activities	of	the	company’s	product	or
service,	 nor	 is	 it	 a	 part	 of	 the	 daily	 operations.	 It	 is	 _extraordinary_ .	 This	 is
important	as	a	stock	investor	because	 _extraordinary_ 	typically	means	something
isn’t	 predictable.	 Benjamin	 Graham	 would	 caution	 his	 students	 to	 pay	 close
attention	to	extraordinary	items	and	try	to	assess	their	impact	on	a	business,	to
manage	and	mitigate	risk.

A	loss	is	also	the	result	of	a	difference	in	the	value	an	asset	is	listed	for	on	the
balance	sheet	and	the	proceeds	received	from	the	sale	of	that	asset.	Let’s	say,	for
example,	that	our	soft	drinks	company	purchased	a	machine	that	speeds	up	the
process	of	getting	the	soft	drinks	into	the	can.	As	a	result,	we	decide	to	sell	the
old	machine.	Since	the	machine	is	somewhat	out	of	date	and	used,	we	are	not
able	to	sell	the	$1,000	machine	for	the	same	price	we	purchased	it	for.	Instead,
we	can	only	sell	it	for	$500.	Since	this	is	$500	less	than	the	amount	we	had	the
machine	listed	for	on	our	balance	sheet	(under	the	property/plant/equipment	line


of	accounting),	we’re	able	to	account	for	a	$500	loss	on	the	income	statement.

```
Getting	into	the	details: 	When	the	old	machine	is	sold,	the	cash	account
(balance	 sheet)	 will	 add	 $500	 for	 the	 funds	 gained	 from	 the	 sale,	 the
property	 account	 (balance	 sheet)	 will	 decrease	 by	 $1,000	 since	 the
machine	is	no	longer	owned	by	the	company,	and	the	loss	line	(income
statement)	will	have	-$500	listed	for	the	difference	between	the	purchase
price	and	the	sales	price.
```
As	mentioned	earlier	in	the	 _Gains	section_ ,	losses	are	considered	non-operating
income	accounts.	Consequently,	you	will	most	likely	find	losses	reported	near
the	bottom	of	the	income	statement.	In	combination,	the	line	is	usually	called
_extraordinary	income/expense,_ 	as	in	our	example,	or	sometimes _	sale	on	assets._
As	the	$275	is	a	positive	number	for	line	11,	we	could	conclude	that	there	has
been	more	extraordinary	income	than	expenses,	or	more	gains	than	losses.

So,	let’s	get	an	overview	of	this	from	our	income	statement	that	will	be	affected
by	the	expenses	and	losses.	Please	note	that	the	 _Net	interest	income/Expenses_
and	 _extraordinary	income/Expenses	_ lines	can	be	both	positive	and	negative.

##### Looking	at	the	income	statement	with	fresh	eyes

Below,	I	have	summarized	this	information.	Don’t	forget	that	if	you	compare	my
income	statement	to	a	random	income	statement,	it	may	not	look	identical.	Don’t
let	that	confuse	you.	All	income	statements	are	built	in	the	same	manner,	and	it
is	only	the	names	of	the	different	lines	and	the	presentation	of	the	numbers	that
are	 different.	 Most	 importantly,	 no	 matter	 how	 you	 compose	 your	 income
statement,	the	intention	is	always	to	show	how	much	net	income	the	company
has	made	at	the	bottom	line.

One	reason	the	income	statement	confuses	many	people	is	because	it	seems	that
revenue	and	expenses	are	arranged	arbitrarily.	The	truth	is,	income	statements
are	constructed	very	logically.	Let’s	take	a	closer	look.


1-3:	These	lines	all	relate	to	the	revenue	and	expenses	from	the	company’s	core
activity.	 In	 the	 case	 of	 Coca-Cola,	 this	 would	 be	 the	 soft	 drinks	 sales	 (1)
subtracted	by	the	costs	of	raw	materials	like	sugar	and	tin	for	making	the	cans


(2).	That	is	also	why	it	is	referred	to	as	 _primary	revenue	and	expenses_ .	Gross
margin	(3)	is	simply	a	summation	of	the	profit	from	the	primary	activities.

4-9:	These	lines	are	all	secondary	expenses.	The	reason	this	is	referred	to	as
_secondary_ is	 because	 there	 are	 a	 variety	 of	 costs	 attached	 to	 running	 the
business.	 In	 the	 case	 of	 Coca-Cola,	 these	 would	 include	 expenses	 for	 doing
commercials	on	TV,	expenses	for	their	trucks	delivering	the	soft	drinks,	and	lots
of	other	types	of	expenses	that	are	not	directly	related	to	the	production	of	the
product	(4-7).	Line	8	simply	summarizes	the	expenses	(8),	while	line	9	applies
those	expenses	to	the	gross	margin	(9).

10-12:	The	common	denominator	for	these	lines	is	that	they	are	non-operating.
Net	interest	income	(10)	can	be	positive	if	the	company	has	money	in	the	bank,
while	it	will	be	an	expense	if	they	have	borrowed	money.	That	is	no	different
from	you	and	me.	As	you	will	recall	from	the	previous	section,	we	sometimes
have	extraordinary	occurrences	(11).	This	could	be,	for	example,	a	building	that
is	sold	for	higher	or	lower	than	what	we	bought	it	for.	Since	real	estate	is	not	part
of	Coca-Cola’s	normal	business,	we	account	for	this	as	 _extraordinary_ .	Finally,
income	taxes	(12)	are	not	part	of	the	operation,	yet	they	need	to	be	paid.

13:	Here	it	is:	Net	income,	the	number	everyone	is	looking	at.	It	tells	us	how
much	profit	the	company	has	made	during	the	year	(13).

##### The	single	lines	in	the	income	statement

When	 I	 was	 first	 learning	 how	 to	 invest	 in	 stocks,	 I	 always	 wanted	 a	 single
source	that	outlined	all	the	terms	within	the	financial	statements.	Hopefully	this
next	section	will	provide	you	with	that	resource.

As	you	go	through	this	section,	it	might	help	if	you	pick	a	company	on	the	stock
exchange	and	print	their	income	statement.	If	you	want	to	go	the	extra	step,	you
might	 even	 write	 the	 corresponding	 page	 number	 from	 this	 book	 next	 to	 the
accounting	line	item	on	your	printed	statement	so	you	can	reference	it	later	on.

**Revenue	(1)**

This	line	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	 _Sales_ 	or	 _Turnover_ .	Revenue	is	the	first	line
item	that	appears	on	the	income	statement	and	simply	refers	to	the	sales	made	by
the	organization;	for	example,	if	Coca-Cola	sold	10	cans	for	$1,	the	revenue	of
the	company	would	be	10*1	=	$10.	Revenue	is	simply	the	quantity	of	goods	sold
multiplied	by	the	price	of	the	product	or	service.	Every	time	you	buy	a	Coke,
you	are	in	fact	increasing	Coca-Cola’s	reported	revenue.

The	above	example	is	a	simplification	of	the	accounting	calculation,	which	is
obviously	more	complex.	This	is	because	the	prices	of	products	and	services	do
not	remain	constant	over	the	year	and	therefore	sales	entries	are	made	on	a	daily
basis	in	order	to	record	the	accurate	revenue	generated	by	the	organization.	From
an	investor’s	point	of	view,	this	is	a	very	important	number.	If	the	organization
is	 unable	 to	 generate	 consistent	 or	 growing	 revenue,	 it	 is	 unlikely	 to	 provide
sufficient	returns	to	its	investors.

Let	us	now	begin	an	analysis	of	the	revenue.	You	might	have	seen	one	simple
figure	stated	in	the	income	statement	reporting	the	revenue	of	Coca-Cola.	As	an
informed	investor,	you	might	need	more	information	regarding	the	generation	of
revenue—especially	if	the	company	has	a	deteriorating	revenue	stream.	If	you
were	interested	in	understanding	why	the	revenue	had	increased,	you	could	dig
deeper	into	the	10K	or	10Q,	where	you’ll	find	a	section	titled	 _Net	Operating
Revenues_.


Regardless	 of	 the	 company	 you	 are	 researching,	 each	 of	 the	 line	 items
throughout	 the	 income	 statement	 should	 be	 explained	 in	 the	 document;	 for
example,	Coca-Cola	segments	its	operations	according	to	geographical	mix	and
therefore	the	revenue	that	is	reported	is	shown	according	to	the	sales	that	have
been	generated	from	a	given	geographical	area.	The	segmented	operations	report
would	 help	 in	 identifying	 the	 segments	 that	 are	 doing	 relatively	 better	 than
segments	that	have	lost	sales	levels.

**Cost	of	revenue	(2)**

This	line	has	many	different	names,	such	as	 _Cost	of	Sales_ ,	 _Costs	of	Goods	Sold_
(often	 referred	 to	 as	 COGS)	 and	 _Production	 Costs_ .	 In	 my	 opinion,	 the	 best
expression	 to	 use	 is	 Cost	 of	 Revenue,	 simply	 because	 this	 is	 what	 the	 line
represents.	 It	 is	 the	 costs	 that	 are	 related	 to	 making	 the	 company’s	 primary
product	or	service.	If	you’re	looking	for	more	details	on	the	derivation	of	this
number,	 you	 can	 dig	 into	 the	 accounting	 policies	 in	 the	 annual	 report.	 It	 is
required	by	law	to	disclose	how	the	cost	of	revenue	is	derived.

Let’s	look	at	an	example.	A	corporation	that	generates	sales	is	likely	to	incur
direct	costs	that	are	associated	with	these	sales;	for	example,	if	Coca-Cola	sells
ten	 cans,	 then	 they	 must	 incur	 some	 form	 of	 manufacturing	 cost	 in	 the
production	of	these	items.	These	costs	might	include	direct	raw	materials	such	as
sugar,	and	indirect	materials	such	as	tin	for	producing	the	cans.	Labor	would
also	be	required	in	the	production	of	goods	and	therefore	all	the	costs	incurred	in
the	 production	 of	 goods	 must	 be	 accounted	 for.	 Any	 company	 that	 deals	 in
manufacturing	goods	would	have	to	make	a	manufacturing	account	separately,
while	a	corporation	that	simply	outsources	the	production	is	likely	to	report	the
total	outsourcing	cost.	The	basic	concept	is	that	all	direct	costs	associated	with
the	production	of	goods	must	be	accounted	for,	and	this	is	shown	within	the	cost
of	revenue	in	the	income	statement.

The	emphasis	is	placed	on	the	term	 _direct	costs_ ;	this	is	because	these	are	the
costs	that	arise	as	a	result	of	per	unit	sales	rather	than	any	other	cost	driver;	for
example,	we	can	easily	ascertain	the	labor	cost	per	unit	or	the	material	required
per	 unit	 of	 production.	 When	 sales	 increase,	 the	 cost	 of	 sales	 must	 increase
respectively;	for	example,	say	that	Coca-Cola	has	direct	labor	costs	of	$0.20	and
direct	material	costs	of	$0.35.	This	makes	the	total	direct	cost	of	$0.55	per	can.
If	the	company	sells	ten	cans,	then	the	total	cost	of	revenue	would	be	10*$0.55	=
$5.5

This	example	indicates	that	when	sales	increase,	the	 _cost_ 	of	sales	must	increase,


given	that	per	unit	rates	remain	constant.	Be	aware	that	the	beverage	company
will	not	incur	cost	of	revenue	before	any	revenue	occurs.	In	the	example	above,
there	will	be	no	cost	of	revenue	recorded	for	the	11th	bottle	before	it	is	sold.

The	question	that	now	arises	is	why	is	the	cost	of	sales	or	revenue	important	to
an	 investor?	 Well,	 cost	 of	 revenue	 is	 typically	 the	 largest	 cost	 accounted	 for
within	the	income	statement	and	determines	the	extent	to	which	the	company	is
able	to	maintain	its	direct	costs	and	generate	a	gross	profit.	An	investor	must
have	 knowledge	 of	 the	 composition	 of	 the	 direct	 costs	 associated	 with	 the
organization;	for	example,	let’s	assume	that	a	company	has	a	very	high	cost	of
revenue.	If	it	cost	Coke	$0.95	to	produce	a	single	drink,	for	instance,	the	$1.00
sale	wouldn’t	provide	a	very	good	margin.	If	the	cost	of	revenue	is	almost	as
high	as	the	revenue,	we	can	quickly	assume	that	the	company	will	struggle	to
ever	 produce	 a	 decent	 profit	 on	 their	 product.	 Remember	 we	 haven’t	 even
accounted	for	secondary	expenses	like	marketing	and	R&D.

Warren	Buffett	states	that	an	investor	must	conduct	a	complete	financial	analysis
of	 a	 company	 before	 buying	 stocks.	 This	 analysis	 includes	 basic	 cost	 drivers
such	as	the	cost	of	revenue.	Coca-Cola,	for	example,	is	mainly	dependent	on
sugar	 for	 the	 manufacturing	 of	 beverages.	 As	 a	 result,	 this	 means	 that	 the
company	 is	 highly	 susceptible	 to	 changes	 in	 sugar	 prices—volatility	 could
quickly	erode	or	produce	profits.

The	investor	must	pay	close	attention	to	the	trends	in	the	cost	of	revenue.	If	sales
are	 constant	 and	 the	 cost	 of	 revenue	 continues	 to	 grow,	 a	 negative	 trend	 is
developing.	Understanding	this	trend	is	the	essence	of	managing	risk	and	return.
This	will	be	examined	in	more	detail	in	the	ratio	analysis	section.

**Gross	profit	(3)**

This	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	the	company’s	 _Margin_ 	or	 _Markup_ .	Gross	profit
is	simply	the	revenue	generated	from	core	products	and	services	less	the	direct
costs	 associated	 with	 the	 production	 of	 goods	 or	 delivery	 of	 service.	 Let’s
continue	with	our	Coca-Cola	example.	The	sales	price	per	bottle	is	$1	while	the
direct	costs	are	$0.55;	sales	less	cost	of	sales	is	equal	to	$0.45,	which	is	in	fact
the	gross	profit	generated	by	the	business.	Gross	profit	in	essence	is	a	measure	of
the	organization’s	efficiency—that	is,	the	ability	of	the	management	to	control
its	direct	cost	of	revenue	while	simultaneously	increasing	sales.

As	 an	 investor,	 you	 cannot	 compare	 the	 gross	 profit	 between	 two	 different
industries.	 This	 often	 leads	 to	 misleading	 assumptions	 and	 doesn’t	 provide	 a


relative	framework	to	assess	a	company’s	performance.	As	an	investor,	you	must
analyze	the	gross	profit,	but	do	not	overanalyze	the	figure	without	a	clear	idea	of
the	underlying	concept	and	industry	standard.

**Sales	and	marketing	expense	(4)**

This	line	is	sometimes	combined	with	 _Administration	Expenses_ 	and	called	 _SGA_
( _Selling,	General	and	Administration_ ).

While	the	sales	and	marketing	expense	is	a	secondary	expense,	and	therefore	not
directly	 related	 to	 the	 product,	 the	 importance	 of	 advertisement	 in	 generating
sales	cannot	be	denied.	Let’s	assume	that	Coca-Cola	introduces	a	new	beverage
but	does	not	advertise	the	product.	Consumers	such	as	you	and	me	would	remain
unaware	of	the	product	and	Coca-Cola	would	be	unlikely	to	generate	sales	from
this	product.

Advertisement	is	one	of	the	greatest	costs	incurred	by	corporations	today.	This
cost	 is	 incorporated	 within	 the	 income	 statement.	 Moreover,	 you	 need	 to
distribute	your	product	to	make	it	available	to	customers.	This	would	lead	to
distribution	 costs,	 which	 would	 typically	 also	 be	 included	 in	 the	 sales	 and
marketing	expense	line.

**Research	and	development	(5)**

Today’s	world	is	consumer-led	and	therefore	companies	carry	out	continuous
research	 and	 development	 operations.	 These	 efforts	 enable	 companies	 to
introduce	new	products	and	services	and	exploit	different	market	segments.	The
need	 to	 continuously	 innovate	 means	 that	 companies	 incur	 costs	 related	 to
research	 for	 particular	 products	 or	 services.	 The	 development	 side	 generally
includes	 the	 prototype	 that	 is	 made	 before	 the	 actual	 product	 goes	 into
production.	These	costs	are	secondary	costs	and	are	therefore	deducted	from	the
gross	profit.

The	research	and	development	costs	incurred	by	different	organizations	might
vary	 according	 to	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 product/service	 for	 the	 industry	 the
corporation	 is	 operating	 in.	 Cell	 phone	 companies,	 for	 example,	 must
continuously	innovate	in	order	to	remain	competitive,	and	therefore	have	high
research	and	development	costs.

Conversely,	 companies	 that	 are	 operating	 in	 stable	 markets	 would	 have	 low
research	 and	 development	 costs.	 Companies	 such	 as	 Coca-Cola	 do	 not	 have
extensive	research	and	development	costs;	this	is	because	they	already	have	a
sustainable	advantage	through	a	product	that	has	been	sold	for	decades.


Remember	 the	 importance	 of	 investing	 in	 a	 company	 that	 has	 a	 durable
competitive	advantage	(discussed	in	Chapter	4,	Principle	3,	Rule	2).	Doing	so
will	 limit	 your	 R&D	 costs	 and	 therefore	 increase	 the	 profit	 margin	 of	 the
company’s	core	competency.

**General	and	administrative	expenses	(6)**

The	 _General	 and	 Administrative_ expense	 typically	 has	 a	 huge	 impact	 on
corporations	 that	 manage	 large-scale	 sales.	 Let’s	 return	 to	 Coca-Cola	 as	 an
example.	 The	 company	 produces	 cans	 and	 incurs	 labor	 costs	 related	 to	 the
operation	of	its	machines.	This	labor	cost	is	directly	associated	with	production
and	therefore	is	a	part	of	the	cost	of	revenue.

Now,	Coca-Cola	has	other	labor	costs	too:	what	about	the	top-notch	white-collar
managers	involved	in	running	the	company?	This	human	resource	does	not	work
for	 free;	 in	 fact	 the	 cost	 per	 person	 is	 immensely	 higher.	 This	 salary	 is	 not
attributed	 to	 the	 cost	 of	 production—instead	 it	 is	 attributable	 to	 an	 overhead
expense	that’s	rolled	into	the	G&A	(General	and	Administrative).

As	 an	 investor,	 beware	 of	 the	 general	 and	 administrative	 expenses	 shown	 in
corporate	 income	 statements.	 Corporations	 are	 likely	 to	 window-dress	 this
figure.	 Study	 these	 expenses	 in	 detail	 and	 identify	 any	 unusual	 trends	 in	 the
figures.	You	might	also	compare	them	to	other	similar	companies	to	ascertain
the	truth	behind	the	reported	figures.

**Other	operating	expenses	(7)**

The	 secondary	 expenses	 are	 endless	 for	 big	 corporations	 as	 there	 might	 be
management	salaries,	depreciation,	rent,	marketing,	advertising	costs,	costs	for
research	 into	 new	 products	 and	 so	 on.	 It	 is	 impossible	 to	 list	 all	 of	 them
separately	and	still	make	the	income	statement	a	single	page.

The	 _Other	Operating	Expenses_ 	in	an	income	statement	simply	refer	to	all	the
overhead	costs	that	cannot	be	categorized	into	the	major	lines	the	company	has
selected	to	represent.	Think	of	it	as	a	catchall	category	for	any	miscellaneous
expense	reporting.	It	could	be	operating	leases	and	IT,	for	instance.

**Operating	expenses	(8)**

This	line	is	simply	a	summation	of	all	the	secondary	expenses.	I	think	that	by
now	you	have	a	good	understanding	of	which	expenses	are	directly	related	to	the
product	and	which	are	incurred	in	the	running	of	the	business.

A	summation	of	all	the	secondary	expenses	gives	the	investor	an	overview	of


how	efficiently	the	company	has	allocated	overhead	costs.

**Income	from	operations	(9)**

This	intermediate	result	is	often	referred	to	as	earnings	before	interest	and	taxes
(EBIT).	 At	 this	 point,	 we	 have	 progressed	 a	 long	 way	 through	 the	 income
statement.	This	is	an	important	stopping	point	because	it	often	gives	the	investor
a	great	look	at	how	the	company	can	handle	its	future	debt	obligations.	Since
financing	 expenses	 haven’t	 been	 subtracted	 out	 of	 the	 company’s	 profit	 yet,
compare	 this	 line	 (income	 from	 operations)	 to	 the	 next	 line	 down	 in	 the
statement	(titled	net	interest	income/expenses)	to	gain	an	understanding	of	the
interest	obligations	(or	debt	payments).	Think	of	it	like	this:	let’s	assume	you
made	$30,000	for	the	year	after	all	your	regular	expenses	were	accounted	for.
Let’s	also	assume	you	have	a	large	amount	of	debt	that	requires	hefty	interest
payments	 every	 year.	 The	 interest	 for	 that	 debt	 is	 $25,000.	 Based	 on	 those
figures,	you	can	quickly	see	that	your	debt	is	devouring	your	ability	to	save	any
money	over	the	long	haul.	In	the	example	of	Coca-Cola,	you	would	compare
lines	9	and	10.	This	would	show	the	company’s	current	profit	(before	the	other
deductions)	at	$4075	and	only	$135	in	interest	owed	to	outstanding	debts.	This	is
a	very	safe	and	respectable	ratio	($135/$4,075	=	3.3%).

So,	that	was	just	a	short	summary	of	what	we	have	learned	so	far.	Now	that	you
have	arrived	at	 _income	from	operations_ ,	think	back	and	analyze	the	importance
of	 this	 figure	 from	 a	 potential	 investor’s	 point	 of	 view.	 Until	 now,	 all	 the
calculations	are	based	on	the	organization’s	operations,	and	as	such	this	figure
indicates	the	profit	generated	as	a	result	of	normal	business	operations.	This	is	of
immense	importance	to	an	investor.

Remember	that	the	basis	of	the	organization	is	to	produce	goods	and	services	in
order	to	maximize	profitability.	Profitability	will	only	be	maximized	when	the
business	is	able	to	control	its	operating	expenses	while	maximizing	its	revenue.
The	 operating	 income	 is	 in	 fact	 an	 indicator	 of	 efficiency,	 and	 the	 operating
margin	indicates	the	business’s	ability	to	generate	a	profit	from	a	given	level	of
sales.

**Net	interest	income/expenses	(10)**

Sometimes	this	line	is	referred	to	as	 _Financial	Items_ 	or	 _Other	Income/Expenses_.
One	reason	this	line	has	different	names	is	because	you	can	really	put	a	lot	into
this	category.

In	my	opinion,	the	most	appropriate	name	for	this	line	would	be	 _net	interest_


_income/expense_ ,	 since	 this	 line	 is	 most	 influenced	 by	 financing	 impacts.
Sometimes	 this	 line	 is	 broken	 into	 two,	 namely	 _Net	Interest	Income_ and	 _Net
Income	 Expense_ ,	 but	 more	 often	 than	 not,	 income	 and	 expenses	 are	 simply
lumped	together	into	one	line	showing	either	a	positive	or	negative	number.

Let’s	take	a	look	at	how	net	interest	income	occurs.	Often,	companies	have	an
amount	of	money	that	is	not	put	into	use.	The	money	is	typically	put	into	a	bank
account	 or	 invested	 in	 short-term	 bonds.	 The	 proceeds	 from	 this	 are	 to	 be
reported	on	the	income	statement	as	net	interest	income.

So	how	does	a	net	interest	expense	arise?	Interest	expense	is	simply	the	cost	of
servicing	debt	that	is	incurred	by	the	organization	when	it	takes	on	debt.	So	that
is	the	exact	opposite	effect	to	the	net	interest	income.	More	often	than	not,	this
line	would	show	a	negative	number	rather	than	a	positive	number.	The	reason
for	this	is	that	companies	use	debt	as	a	financing	source,	while	keeping	money	in
the	bank	to	provide	flexibility	for	their	daily	operations.

As	 previously	 discussed	 in	 the	 prior	 line	 item,	 let’s	 take	 another	 look	 at	 the
impact	of	a	high	net	interest	expense.	Assuming	a	company	takes	out	a	bank
loan	for	$100,000	and	it	has	been	told	that	the	interest	rate	is	10%,	we	know	that
the	interest	expense	is	going	to	be	$10,000	per	year.	If	the	company’s	income
from	 operations	 (line	 9)	 is	 only	 $20,000,	 we	 quickly	 see	 half	 our	 profits
destroyed	because	of	the	loan.	Net	interest	expenses	are	taken	directly	out	of	the
pockets	of	the	owners,	so	be	very	careful	if	the	company	pays	too	many	interest
expenses.	As	an	aside,	the	company	would	also	need	to	set	up	a	sunk	account
(on	the	balance	sheet)	in	order	to	set	aside	money	each	year	to	pay	back	the
principal	 on	 the	 $100,000.	 The	 $10,000	 paid	 annually	 would	 only	 cover	 the
interest	on	the	loan.

Also	remember	that	this	line	is	not	only	financial	items;	it	is	also	other	revenue
and	expenses	that	are	not	part	of	the	company’s	daily	operations.	It	could	be
income	 generated	 from	 other	 resources	 like	 renting	 out	 a	 certain	 area	 of
property.	 In	 this	 case,	 the	 rent	 income	 generated	 from	 this	 investment	 is	 not
revenue	derived	from	primary	activities,	but	rather	revenue	allocated	in	this	line.
It	could	also	relate	to	multinational	companies	with	widespread	operations	that
are	 likely	 to	 be	 impacted	 by	 foreign	 exchange	 risk	 adjustments	 in	 an	 either
positive	or	negative	manner.

**Extraordinary	income/expenses	(11)**

The	name	says	it	all.	 _Extraordinary	_ is	something	that	is	not	part	of	the	daily


operations	and	cannot	be	predicted.	This	may	sound	a	bit	vague,	but	let	me	give
you	 a	 few	 examples.	 Large	 companies	 in	 particular	 experience	 lawsuits	 from
time	to	time.	A	loss	incurred	from	a	lawsuit	is	very	hard	to	predict	and	can	be
categorized	as	a	one-time	event.

Another	example	would	be	the	costs	incurred	from	restructuring	charges.	If	a
company	decides	to	close	down	a	subsidiary,	merge	two	divisions,	or	for	any
other	reason	decides	to	change	the	organization,	a	number	of	costs	are	likely	to
occur.	For	instance,	it	could	be	personnel	receiving	severance	pay.	Again,	this	is
something	 that	 we	 cannot	 expect	 to	 happen	 on	 a	 regular	 basis.	 This	 is
extraordinary.

It	does	not	have	to	be	an	expense,	though.	Sometimes	an	extraordinary	income
can	also	occur.	Imagine	that	Coca-Cola	just	bought	a	new	building	and	land	for
the	price	of	$5,000,000.	A	real	estate	company	wants	to	buy	the	building	and
subdivide	the	land	for	smaller	homes.	Coca-Cola	is	offered	$6,000,000	for	the
land	and	a	profit	of	$1,000,000	is	born.	Since	subdividing	of	land	is	not	a	part	of
Coca-Cola’s	 primary	 activities,	 it	 can	 report	 the	 profit	 as	 an	 extraordinary
income.	When	you	are	trying	to	determine	the	true	cash	flow	of	a	business,	many
investors	 exclude	 extraordinary	 income	 in	 their	 model.	 That	 said,	 many
conservative	analysts	will	include	average	extraordinary	expenses	(for	example,
the	average	annual	expense	over	a	five-year	period)

**Income	taxes	(12)**

I	 made	 a	 promise.	 I	 promised	 that	 the	 income	 statement	 was	 not	 hard	 to
understand.	 Don’t	 worry;	 I	 am	 sticking	 to	 my	 promise,	 because	 even	 income
taxes	are	not	that	hard	to	understand.	Just	above	the	line	labeled	 _Income	Taxes,_
you	will	sometimes	find	a	line	called	 _Income	Before	Tax_ 	or	 _Pretax Income_ .	For
simplicity,	this	line	is	not	included	in	the	example	within	this	chapter.

Based	on	this	amount,	every	company	will	have	to	pay	income	taxes.	If	the	tax
rate	is	30%	and	the	income	before	tax	is	$100,	the	company	would	have	to	pay
$30	in	tax.

Okay,	I	kept	my	promise	so	far.	Well,	now	it	may	get	harder	to	follow.	If	you
look	 at	 most	 companies’	 annual	 reports,	 you	 will	 probably	 not	 find	 the
calculations	 as	 simple	 and	 consistent	 as	 the	 one	 given	 above.	 Sometimes	 a
company	will	pay	10%	effectively	in	tax,	sometimes	40%,	and	more	often	than
not,	something	in	between.

The	reasons	for	the	deviation	in	effective	tax	rates	are	many.	A	large	corporation


located	in	many	different	countries	has	to	pay	some	of	the	taxes	in	that	country,
and	tax	rates	vary	between	countries.	Also,	if	a	company	shows	a	deficit	one
year,	it	can	carry	the	loss	forward	to	obtain	tax	relief.	Some	sectors,	such	as
banking	and	energy,	are	regulated	by	a	different	set	of	tax	legislation	than	other
sectors.

So	does	this	mean	you	should	just	take	the	tax	rate	as	given	and	not	worry	about
it?	No.	Tax	is	a	huge	expense	for	any	company	and,	just	as	you	would	rather
invest	in	a	company	with	an	efficient	R&D	department,	you	would	also	rather
invest	in	a	company	with	a	lower	tax	rate.	You	should	look	for	the	effective	tax
rate	 _over	time_ ,	and	not	a	single	snapshot	in	time.	Like	most	things	in	accounting,
the	 important	 thing	 is	 understanding	 a	 company’s	 tax	 trends.	 Look	 for
consistencies—and	when	you	don’t	find	them,	understand	why.

**Net	income	(13)**

This	 is	 sometimes	 referred	 to	 as	 the	 _Profit	for	the	Year_ or	 _Net	Income	from
Continued	Operations_.

You	can	now	take	a	sigh	of	relief.	You	are	at	the	very	bottom	at	the	statement.
You	are	home	free!

When	you	think	about	it,	it	was	not	that	hard,	was	it?	You	took	all	the	different
types	 of	 revenues	 and	 gains,	 and	 then	 subtracted	 all	 the	 different	 types	 of
expenses	and	losses.	And	what	did	you	get?	You	ended	up	with	the	net	income.
Always	remember	that	income	statements	really	 _are	_ that	simple.

##### A	final	review	of	the	income	statement

At	 this	 point,	 you	 should	 have	 a	 much	 deeper	 understanding	 of	 the	 income
statement.	But	let’s	just	look	at	it	one	final	time.	It	doesn’t	look	as	intimidating
anymore,	does	it?

```
Annual	(year	2014)	Income	statement in	millions
1 Revenue 13,279 Primary	revenue
2 Cost	of	revenue 5,348 Primary	expense
1-2	=	3 Gross	margin 7,931 Summation
```
```
4 Sales	and	marketing	expenses 1,105 Secondary	expense
```
```
5 Research	and	development	expenses 863 Secondary	expense
```

```
6 General	and	administration	expenses 538 Secondary	expense
7 Other	operating	expenses 1,350 Secondary	expense
4+5+6+7	=	8 Operating	expenses 3,856 Summation
```
```
3-8	=	9 Income	from	operations 4,075 Summation
```
```
10 Net	interest	income/(expenses) (135)
```
```
Secondary	revenue	or	(financial
expenses)
```
```
11 Extraordinary	income/(expenses) 275 Gains	or	(losses)
12 Income	taxes 1,352
9+10+11-12	=	13 Net	income 2,863 Summation
```
My	goal	is	to	demystify	the	income	statement	completely	for	you.	Perhaps	you
feel	that	there	is	some	information	you	are	missing.	Where	is	depreciation,	for
instance?	 What	 about	 the	 income	 before	 tax?	 You	 will	 surely	 find	 a	 lot	 of
different	accounting	terms	in	the	income	statement	for	any	given	company	that	is
not	presented	in	the	example	above.

To	illustrate	my	point,	let’s	look	at	depreciation.	Where	is	that	in	the	income
statement?	 Well,	 first	 let	 us	 remember	 that	 depreciation	 is	 simply	 the	 loss	 of
accounting	value	for	an	asset.	Imagine	a	car	with	a	value	of	$10,000	that	is	to	be
depreciated	in	five	years.	This	means	that	there	would	be	a	yearly	expense	of
$2,000.	Clearly,	depreciation	is	a	major	expense	for	companies.	So	where	is	it?

It	is	actually	already	included!	The	cars	used	by	the	salespeople	are	included	in
the	 _Sales	and	Marketing	Expenses_ .	The	cars	used	by	the	executives	are	included
in	 the	 _General	 and	 Administration_ expenses.	 I	 could	 choose	 to	 show
depreciation	in	a	single	line.	That	would	have	made	the	income	statement	more
detailed,	 but	 it	 would	 also	 be	 harder	 to	 keep	 the	 overview.	 That	 is	 always	 a
tradeoff.	Just	remember:	the	revenue,	expenses,	and	therefore	also	the	bottom
line,	are	always	the	same	no	matter	how	they	are	presented.

If	you	had	the	luxury	of	viewing	the	full	income	statement	of	a	large	company
such	as	Coca-Cola,	you	would	find	that	it	has	numerous	subordinate	rows	for
each	item;	for	example,	the	 _Revenue_ 	line	item	might	have	fifty	subordinate	lines
that	encompass	that	number.	Your	interest	in	uncovering	all	the	facts	behind	the
numbers	is	a	direct	result	of	your	assumption	of	risk	and	capital	involved	in	the


company.

Let’s	 look	 at	 _income	 before	 tax_ .	 You	 will	 often	 find	 this	 line	 in	 income
statements	as	a	summation	line	just	above	the	 _Income	Taxes_ .	The	reason	you
sometimes	see	this	line	is	because	some	find	it	useful	to	compare	companies
before	tax.	If	you	feel	the	same	way,	you	should	not	be	discouraged	that	it	is	not
included	in	the	income	statement	above.	You	can	simply	calculate	it	yourself.

As	you	see,	a	lot	of	the	lines	you	may	read	about	in	other	income	statements	are
already	presented	in	the	income	statement	you	now	know	so	well.	Still,	you	may
see	lines	and	expressions	that	you	are	unfamiliar	with.	If	that’s	the	case,	a	simple
Google	search	should	quickly	add	some	light	to	your	understanding.	The	core
fundamentals	 of	 how	 the	 statement	 works	 are	 the	 most	 important	 aspects	 to
learn.

##### Ratio	analysis	for	the	income	statement

So	now	we	are	done	with	the	income	statement—right?	You	can	now	read	and
understand	income	statements	for	most	companies	with	no	major	problems.	It’s
great,	isn’t	it?	All	that	hard	work	paying	off!

So	what	is	this	ratio	analysis	all	about	then?	Well,	the	explanation	is	actually
quite	simple.	As	a	value	investor,	you	are	not	only	interested	in	finding	a	great
company;	preferably,	you	would	choose	the	very	best	company	to	invest	in—and
that	 is	 really	 where	 the	 ratio	 analysis	 comes	 in.	 Comparing	 two	 different
companies,	you	can	look	at	which	company	makes	the	highest	gross	profit	or	net
income.

The	 thorough	 value	 investor	 would	 look	 into	 ratios	 for	 several	 years	 when
comparing	different	companies,	and	he	will	look	for	trends	and	explanations	for
the	development.	He	also	knows	that,	for	the	most	accurate	analysis,	he	must
compare	companies	within	the	same	sector.

To	 illustrate	 the	 ratio	 analysis,	 I	 have	 chosen	 to	 introduce	 you	 to	 the	 main
profitability	ratios,	and	I	will	continue	to	use	Coca-Cola	as	a	generic	example.
For	comparison,	I	have	chosen	Coke’s	competitor,	Pepsi.


**Annual	(year	2014)	Income	statement in	millions**

1 Revenue 13,279

2 Cost	of	revenue 5,348

1-2	=	3 Gross	Margin 7,931

4 Sales	and	Marketing	expenses 1,105

5 Research	and	development	expenses 863

6 General	and	Administration	expenses 538

7 Other	operating	expenses 1,350

4+5+6+7	=	8 Operating	expenses 3,856

3-8	=	9 Income	from	operations 4,075

10 Net	interest	income/(expenses) (135)

11 Extraordinary	income/(expenses) 275

12 Income	taxes 1,352

9+10+11-12	=	13 Net	income 2,863


**Gross	profit	margin	ratio**

So,	let’s	go	back	to	our	generic	example	of	the	income	statement.	The	company
has	revenue	of	$13,279	and	a	cost	of	revenue	of	$5,348.	In	total,	this	would	yield
a	gross	profit	of	$7,931.

Let’s	calculate	the	gross	profit	margin	ratio:

```
Gross	Profit	Margin	Ratio	=	Gross	Profit	(line	3)	/	Revenue	(line	1)
7,931	/	13,279	=	59.7%
```
So	what	does	the	59.7%	tell	us?	It	tells	us	that	every	time	Coca-Cola	sells	soft
drinks	for	$100,	it	makes	$59.7	in	gross	profit.	That	is	when	all	the	costs	directly
related	to	the	product	are	subtracted—for	example,	sugar,	the	cost	of	the	tin	cans
and	so	on.

This	is	a	very	neat	measure	to	have.	Not	only	have	we	started	an	analysis	for
Coca-Cola	which	tells	us	how	efficient	they	are	at	controlling	their	direct	costs;
now	we	also	have	a	starting	point	for	comparing	with	a	competitor.

If	you,	as	a	value	investor,	are	starting	to	take	a	closer	look	at	Coca-Cola,	it
would	also	make	sense	to	take	a	closer	look	at	Pepsi.	This	is	where	ratio	analysis
shows	its	strength.	Even	though	there	is	a	significant	difference	in	the	size	of	the
companies,	 the	 ratio	 would	 provide	 a	 comparable	 metric	 between	 companies.
Let’s	assume	that	Pepsi	has	a	gross	profit	of	$805	and	revenue	of	$1,283.	Then
Pepsi’s	gross	profit	margin	ratio	would	be	805/1,283	=	62.7%.

In	 this	 generic	 example,	 Pepsi	 showed	 to	 be	 even	 more	 profitable	 (relatively
speaking)	than	Coca-Cola,	even	though	the	company	in	absolute	numbers	had	a
much	lower	revenue	and	gross	profit.

**Operating	margin	ratio**

It	probably	comes	as	no	surprise	how	the	operating	margin	is	calculated.	Instead
of	gross	profit,	we	simply	insert	the	operating	margin	into	the	formula.	Based	on
our	income	statement,	we	will	obtain	the	following	result:

Operating	Margin	Ratio	=	Income	from	Operations	(line	9)	/	Revenue	(line	1)

```
4,075	/	13,279	=	30.7%
```
So	 what	 does	 the	 30.7%	 tell	 us?	 If	 the	 operating	 margin	 for	 Coca-Cola	 was
30.7%,	it	would	tell	us	that	every	time	it	sells	soft	drinks	for	$100,	it	will	make
$30.7	in	operating	profit.	That	is	not	only	when	the	cost	of	revenue	such	as	sugar
and	 tin	 cans	 are	 sold,	 but	 also	 secondary	 expenses	 like	 administration,


marketing,	 distribution	 and	 all	 the	 other	 costs	 related	 to	 Coca-Cola’s	 daily
business	are	deducted.

Again,	we	could	take	a	look	at	a	competitor	such	as	Pepsi	and	see	how	they
performed.	Let’s	assume	that	the	income	from	operations	is	$376	for	Pepsi.	The
operating	margin	would	then	be	376/1,283	=	29.3%.	Now,	this	is	interesting!	In
our	example,	Pepsi	had	a	 _higher_ 	gross	margin	but	also	a	 _lower_ 	operating	margin
ratio.	In	other	words,	this	analysis	shows	us	that	while	Pepsi	is	more	efficient	in
controlling	cost	directly	related	to	the	sale	of	soft	drinks,	the	company	is	less
efficient	when	you	include	the	daily	costs	of	running	the	business.	You,	as	an
investor,	might	find	it	interesting	to	investigate	why	Pepsi’s	secondary	expenses
are	higher	than	Coke’s.

**Net	income	margin	ratio**

Now	 we	 have	 arrived	 at	 the	 very	 bottom	 of	 the	 income	 statement.	 We	 still
compare	with	the	revenue,	which	is	our	starting	point,	but	now	we	look	at	the
big	picture.	The	formula	looks	like	this:

```
Net	Income	Margin	Ratio	=	Net	Income	(line	13)	/	Revenue	(line	1)
2,863	/	13,279	=	21.6%
```
What	does	this	number	tell	us?	Assuming	that	Coca-Cola	sells	soft	drinks	for
$100,	of	this	amount,	$21.6	will	be	translated	into	profit.	And	keep	in	mind	that
we	are	looking	at	the	net	profit	margin	ratio.	This	is	the	money	that	the	investors
made	in	profit	compared	to	money	the	business	collected	for	the	sale	of	every
product.

Let’s	compare	with	Pepsi	again.	Assume	that	Pepsi	has	a	net	profit	of	$158.	That
way,	Pepsi	would	have	a	net	profit	margin	ratio	of	158/1,283	=	12.3%.	This	is
even	more	interesting!	For	the	operating	margin,	Coca-Cola	showed	a	slightly
better	performance	than	Pepsi,	but	for	the	net	income	margin,	there’s	a	huge
difference.

This	must	simply	mean	that	Pepsi	has	large	non-operating	expenses	that	Coca-
Cola	 doesn’t	 have.	 Remember	 lines	 10,	 11	 and	 12	 in	 the	 income	 statement?
Without	even	looking	at	Pepsi’s	income	statement,	we	would	know	that	Pepsi
might	have	high	interest	expenses	(meaning	they	have	more	debt),	they	might
have	 incurred	 losses	 from	 extraordinary	 expenses,	 or	 they	 had	 large	 taxes	 in
comparison	to	Coca-Cola.

From	 this	 generic	 profitability	 ratio	 analysis,	 we	 can	 therefore	 conclude	 that


Coca-Cola	is	a	more	profitable	company	than	Pepsi	when	all	expenses	and	losses
are	included.

Now,	let’s	discuss	the	really	important	part	with	any	ratio	analysis—trends.	So
when	we	look	at	this	snapshot	in	time,	a	person	might	try	and	conclude	that
Coke	is	a	better	company	than	Pepsi.	Although	this	could	be	true	for	the	year
you	assessed,	you’ll	probably	have	a	better	indication	of	the	truth	by	analyzing
the	ratios	from	year	to	year.	This	trend	analysis	is	the	heart	of	understanding	the
prospects	for	future	performance;	for	example,	Coke	might	have	better	numbers
this	year,	but	for	the	last	five	years,	Pepsi’s	ratios	might	be	improving	while
Cokes	are	becoming	worse.	If	these	trends	are	stable	and	even	predictable,	this
qualitative	improvement	to	profit	margin	maybe	of	value	in	assessing	long-term
risk.

**Interest	coverage	ratio:**

A	 final	 pointer	 to	 the	 ratio	 analysis	 of	 the	 income	 statement	 is	 the	 interest
coverage	ratio	(similar	to	an	idea	previous	discussed	in	the	net	interest	section).
This	is	a	very	important	ratio	for	minimizing	your	risk.	We	already	looked	at	the
debt/equity	ratio,	which	was	one	of	Warren	Buffett’s	four	principles.	This	ratio
is	similar	to	the	debt/equity	ratio,	only	this	is	determining	the	immediate	impacts
of	debt.	Think	of	it	like	this:

```
Interest	coverage	ratio—“I	have	$2,000	of	spending	money	at	the	end	of
each	month,	but	$1,500	of	that	goes	towards	paying	the	interest	on	all	my
loans.”
Debt/Equity	 ratio—“I	 have	 $100,000	 of	 total	 debt	 and	 my	 net	 worth	 is
only	$50,000.”
```
As	you	can	see,	the	interest	coverage	ratio	is	an	important	number	because	it
shows	 the	 reality	 of	 a	 company’s	 ability	 to	 keep	 its	 head	 above	 water.	 If	 a
company	cannot	pay	for	its	interest	expenses,	it	is	heading	for	trouble—fast.

The	formula	looks	like	this:

```
Interest	Coverage	Ratio	=	Income	from	Operations	(line	9)	/	Interest	Expense	(line	10)
4,075	/	135	=	30.2
```
If	these	were	the	real	numbers	for	Coca-Cola,	it	would	mean	that	the	company
would	 be	 able	 to	 pay	 the	 interest	 expenses	 as	 much	 as	 30.2	 times	 from	 the
operating	income.	That	is	very	safe!	As	a	rule	of	thumb,	I	like	to	see	a	stable
interest	 coverage	 ratio	 of	 at	 least	 five	 times	 the	 operating	 income.	 That	 also


means	that	if	we	compared	with	a	competitor	like	Pepsi,	and	Pepsi	showed	to
have	an	interest	coverage	ratio	of	50,	it	would	not	make	sense	to	conclude	that
Pepsi	 is	 less	 risky.	 Both	 companies	 would	 be	 categorized	 as	 stable	 and	 safe
companies.

**Conclusion:**

As	we	look	at	the	ratio	analysis	of	any	given	company,	the	two	important	ratios
that	I	like	to	consider	are	the	net-margin	ratio	and	interest	coverage	ratio.

The	 net-margin	 ratio	 is	 important	 because	 it	 shows	 you	 the	 company’s	 profit
margin;	for	example,	if	the	company	sells	$100	in	soft	drinks,	its	bottom-line
profit	might	be	$20.	This	would	be	a	ratio	of	.20.	Or	20	cents	for	every	dollar
sold.	 If	 a	 company	 has	 a	 low	 profit	 margin,	 it	 often	 means	 they	 lack	 the
flexibility	and	agility	of	a	company	with	a	strong	margin.

The	interest	coverage	ratio	is	extremely	important	because	it	indicates	risk,	or
lack	of	risk.	Properly	identifying	risks	and	mitigating	your	exposure	will	protect
your	 principal	 investment	 and	 provide	 sustainable	 returns	 over	 long	 holding
periods.


# Chapter	7	

## Balance	Sheet	in	Detail

I	 first	 introduced	 the	 balance	 sheet	 in	 Chapter	 3.	 Back	 then	 I	 introduced	 the
balance	sheet	by	comparing	your	personal	finances	with	those	of	a	company.	In
this	chapter,	we	will	dig	into	the	world	of	accounting	and	see	what	each	line	in
the	balance	sheet	is	composed	of.	First,	let	us	recall	what	the	balance	sheet	was
all	about.



## Introduction	to	the	balance	sheet

The	 balance	 sheet	 is	 sectionalized	 into	 three	 major	 categories:	 the	 assets,	 the
equity,	 and	 the	 liabilities.	 In	 my	 opinion,	 the	 easiest	 way	 to	 explain	 the
relationship	is	by	looking	at	the	assets	first.	The	assets	are	what	the	company
owns.	If	we	look	at	a	company	like	Coca-Cola,	the	company	owns	a	variety	of
assets.	It	could	be	buildings,	machines,	the	cans	of	Coke	that	are	produced	but
not	yet	sold.

Assets	 can	 be	 financed	 two	 ways:	 with	 the	 company’s	 money—this	 is	 called
_equity;_ 	or	with	someone	else’s	money—this	is	called	 _liabilities_ .	That’s	the	most
important	thing	to	understand	when	first	thinking	about	the	balance	sheet.	Let
me	give	you	an	example	of	a	simplified	balance	sheet:

```
Assets Equity
$	10,000 S	2,000
```
```
Liability
$	8,000
```
The	balance	sheet	is	very	basic,	and	its	mechanics	are	not	harder	than	the	figures
you	see	here.	Let	us	imagine	that	you	bought	a	car	at	a	price	of	$10,000.	You
make	a	down	payment	of	$2,000,	and	you	borrow	the	remaining	$8,000	from	the
bank.	As	you	will	see	here,	it	is	very	simple.	When	you	have	an	asset,	it	is	either
financed	by	your	own	money	(equity)	or	by	someone	else’s	money	(liabilities).

Because	 assets	 are	 either	 financed	 by	 equity	 or	 liabilities,	 the	 two	 sides	 will
always	be	equal.	They	will	 _balance._

Now,	let’s	take	a	more	realistic	look	at	a	balance	sheet.	Sure,	they	might	own
more	assets	than	just	a	car,	but	the	principle	is	the	same.


To	make	this	as	simple	as	possible,	I	have	put	numbers	next	to	the	corresponding
accounts.	That	way	you	can	easily	follow	how	the	balance	sheet	is	constructed.

##### Assets

Let’s	start	digging	into	assets.	When	you	think	about	assets,	you	might	see	cars
and	buildings	in	your	mind.	But	how	do	we	define	assets?	Well,	in	accounting,


we	say	that	 _assets	are	something	that	is	owned	and	expected	to	generate	income
for	the	company_ .	It	sounds	simple,	doesn’t	it?	When	I	am	in	doubt	as	to	whether
something	is	an	asset	or	a	liability,	this	is	the	definition	I	think	of:	Can	it	make
money	for	the	company?

That	is	not	all	there	is	to	the	story,	though.	Before	talking	too	much	about	the
single	types	of	assets,	let	us	look	at	the	two	different	categories	of	assets:	the
non-current	and	the	current	assets.

A	current	asset	can	be	defined	as	any	asset	which	is	likely	to	be	converted	into
cash	 _within	a	period	of	one	year_ .	The	easiest	example	of	a	current	asset	is	cash
itself.	Other	examples	include	inventory	and	receivables.

Non-current	 assets	 are	 sometimes	 referred	 to	 as	 long-term	 assets.	 An
organization	simply	includes	those	assets	that	have	an	expected	ownership	over
a	 period	 _exceeding	one	year_ and	 cannot	 immediately	 be	 converted	 into	 cash.
Examples	of	non-current	assets	could	be	machines	for	production,	buildings	and
cars.

Why	do	accountants	go	through	so	much	effort	in	order	to	define	different	asset
types?	The	idea	between	distinguishing	various	kinds	of	assets	is	to	present	to
the	reader	a	true	and	fair	view	of	a	company’s	financial	condition.	That	is	also
why	 the	 balance	 sheet	 is	 sometimes	 referred	 to	 as	 _the	statement	of	financial
position_.

**Current	assets**

Now	it	is	time	to	look	at	the	current	assets.	As	you	will	recall,	current	assets	are
something	 that	 the	 company	 expects	 to	 turn	 into	 cash	 within	 the	 next	 twelve
months.	I	have	chosen	to	list	the	current	assets	in	order	of	liquidity,	starting	with
the	most	liquid	assets	first.	Once	again,	I	am	using	Coca-Cola	for	this	generic
example.

_Cash	and	cash	equivalents	(1	-	Asset	Column)_

This	 line	 is	 sometimes	 referred	 to	 as	 _cash,	cash	equivalents,	and	marketable
securities_ .	When	we	think	of	cash,	it	includes	both	any	cash	kept	in	a	register
and	cash	that	is	safely	stored	away	in	a	bank	account.

Cash	equivalents	are	equal	to	having	cash	that	is	currently	in	a	different	form;
for	 example,	 money	 market	 funds,	 saving	 deposits	 and	 deposit	 certificates.
These	 can	 be	 readily	 converted	 into	 cash	 and	 are	 therefore	 termed	 as	 _cash
equivalents_.

_Accounts	receivables	(2	-	Asset	Column)_


_Accounts	receivables	(2	-	Asset	Column)_

This	 line	 is	 sometimes	 called	 _receivables_ ,	 or	 _net	 receivables_ .	 Most	 of	 a
business’s	sales	tend	to	be	carried	out	on	credit	as	opposed	to	cash;	for	example,
Coca-Cola	could	sell	soft	drinks	to	Wal-Mart	on	credit	for	$1,000.

This	payment	is	in	effect	an	asset	for	Coca-Cola	because	it	will	be	turned	into
cash	at	a	later	date.	Typically,	this	would	happen	within	60-90	days.	This	also
means	that	receivables,	in	reality,	are	an	interest-free	loan	provided	by	Coca-
Cola	to	Wal-Mart.	As	the	payment	will	typically	happen	within	twelve	months,
it	is	categorized	as	a	 _current	asset_.

Most	often,	this	line	is	made	up	by	the	credit	sales	of	goods	or	services,	but	it
can	also	contain	expected	current	payments	such	as	interest	on	various	securities.
In	that	case,	you	might	see	that	the	name	of	this	account	is	simply	 _receivables_ .	In
short,	this	is	money	that	is	expected	to	flow	into	the	company	but	is	yet	to	be
received.

_Inventory	(3	-	Asset	Column)_

This	line	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	 _stock_ .	Almost	all	companies	have	some	sort
of	inventory.	Typically,	the	inventory	is	subdivided	into	three	categories:	 _raw
materials,	work	in	progress,	_ and _	finished	goods_.

For	Coca-Cola,	sugar	is	a	very	important	component.	The	raw	sugar	that	they
buy	will	go	directly	into	the	inventory.	This	subcategory	is	simply	called	 _raw
material_ .	The	value	of	the	raw	material	is	simply	the	cost	of	the	products.

Clearly,	the	soft	drinks	also	have	to	be	made.	A	soft	drink	is	made	in	different
stages	ranging	from	when	it	is	just	raw	material	until	it	is	ready	to	drink.	During
that	process,	extra	costs	are	incurred.	Labor	costs	for	managing	the	machines
could	be	an	example.	This	subcategory	for	inventory	is	called	 _work	in	progress_.

When	the	soft	drinks	are	made	and	just	waiting	to	be	sold,	this	subcategory	for
inventory	is	called	 _finished	goods_ .	Again,	additional	costs	have	been	incurred	to
finish	the	products;	an	example	could	be	the	costs	for	packaging	the	products.

When	 you	 read	 the	 inventory	 line	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet,	 you	 see	 a	 complete
summation	of	all	three	categories	of	inventory.	If	you	are	interested,	the	annual
report	will	often	provide	you	with	a	note	that	tells	you	the	exact	composition.

_Other	current	assets	(4	-	Asset	Column)_

Any	current	assets	that	do	not	meet	any	of	the	three	previous	categories	fall	into
this	catchall	row,	 _other	current	assets_ .	These	assets	are	likely	to	be	converted


into	cash	within	twelve	months	and	may	include	property,	plant	and	equipment
available	for	sale,	or	any	other	asset	that	is	expected	to	be	sold	within	the	year.

This	 category	 might	 also	 include	 derivatives	 that	 are	 designated	 as	 hedging
instruments	 such	 as	 foreign	 currency	 contracts	 and	 commodity	 contracts.	 If	 a
company	 owns	 derivative	 contracts,	 it’s	 likely	 a	 way	 for	 the	 company	 to
minimize	their	risk	and	exposure	to	a	flexible	and	unpredictable	market—like
sugar	prices.

_Prepaid	expenses	(5	-	Asset	Column)_

A	firm	sometimes	pays	off	some	of	its	expenses	before	it	actually	incurs	them;
for	example,	let’s	assume	that	Coca-Cola	is	engaged	in	marketing	and	has	paid
its	customers	distribution	rights	in	advance	for	six	months.	Assuming	Coca-Cola
made	this	payment	at	the	end	of	November,	we	would	have	another	five	months
of	 funds	 remaining	 in	 this	 account	 to	 demonstrate	 the	 distribution	 that’s	 still
going	 to	 occur.	 As	 this	 action	 is	 consumed	 each	 month,	 this	 account	 will
gradually	decrease	and	the	funds	will	be	realized	onto	the	income	statement	as
an	expense.

The	 prepaid	 expenses	 tend	 to	 be	 the	 most	 illiquid	 item	 in	 the	 current	 assets
category.	Imagine	that	Coca-Cola	was	in	a	liquidity	crisis	(meaning	they	need
cash	fast).	Most	likely	the	contractual	terms	would	not	allow	Coca-Cola	to	ask
for	such	a	reversal	of	funds	that	have	already	been	paid.	It	would	be	similar	to	a
person	asking	for	a	refund	on	a	magazine	subscription	that	was	paid	for	at	the
beginning	of	the	year.	That’s	why	you’ll	find	prepaid	expenses	listed	at	the	very
bottom	of	the	current	assets	column;	it’s	the	“thickest”	and	most	difficult	to	turn
back	into	cash.

_Total	current	assets	(6	-	Asset	Column)_

Adding	up	all	assets	that	you	expect	to	turn	into	cash	during	the	next	twelve
months	for	Coca-Cola,	you	have	the	total	current	assets.	As	you	can	see	in	the
numbered	Balance	Sheet,	line	6	is	found	by	the	summation	of	lines	1	through	5
in	the	asset	column.

**Non-current	assets**

So	let’s	take	a	look	at	the	non-current	assets.	These	are	the	assets	that	will	 _not_
turn	into	cash	within	the	next	twelve	months.

_Non-current	receivables	(7	-	Asset	Column)_

A	receivable	is	an	amount	of	money	that	the	company	expects	to	get	back	from


another	party.	Since	it	is	non-current,	it	is	money	that	is	expected	to	be	paid
back,	 but	 not	 within	 the	 next	 twelve	 months.	 Often	 in	 business,	 you	 sell	 on
credit.	For	very	large	companies,	contracts	can	easily	be	made	more	than	a	year,
and	sometimes	the	full	payment	will	not	be	made	until	the	contract	is	terminated.

_Non-current	investments	(8	-	Asset	Column)_

This	 line	 is	 sometimes	 referred	 to	 as	 _long-term	 investments_ .	 Sometimes	 a
company	is	involved	in	long-term	investments	in	an	attempt	to	generate	income
from	non-operating	assets.	That	could	be	Coca-Cola	buying	companies	that	are
not	directly	related	to	soft	drinks,	for	example.	Other	than	shares,	a	company
might	have	bonds	and	debt	securities	that	might	be	available	for	sale	or	held	to
maturity.

As	an	investor,	you	are	right	to	question	why	a	company	should	have	long-term
investments.	 You	 might	 argue	 that	 a	 company	 with	 a	 high	 number	 of
investments	would	tend	to	concentrate	less	on	core	activities.	That	is	typically	a
bad	sign.	Conversely,	investments	such	as	these	might	signify	a	diversification
policy	so	earnings	are	maintained	despite	changes	in	external	environments.

_Property,	plant,	and	equipment	(9	-	Asset	Column)_

This	line	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	 _PPE_ .	As	the	name	depicts,	it	refers	to	those
tangible	 assets	 that	 can	 be	 classified	 under	 property,	 plant	 or	 equipment.
Ranging	from	buildings	to	property	and	from	manufacturing	equipment	to	mere
office	 furniture,	 this	 is	 a	 category	 of	 assets	 that	 investors	 find	 particularly
interesting.

A	company’s	non-current	assets	determine	the	organization’s	operating	capacity.
A	company	like	Coca-Cola	that	manufactures	a	certain	product	is	likely	to	have
a	large	PPE	balance—as	opposed	to	an	organization	that	merely	resells	products
or	provides	services.

While	it	may	seem	tempting	to	own	a	lot	of	buildings	and	equipment,	very	often
some	 of	 the	 largest	 expenses	 for	 a	 company	 relate	 to	 this	 category	 of	 assets.
Tangible	assets	will	often	have	to	be	replaced,	and	that’s	a	very	expensive	bill
that	has	to	be	paid.	Think	of	a	company	like	Hilton	Resorts.	They	will	constantly
have	 building	 upgrades	 and	 interior	 remodeling	 expenses	 in	 order	 to	 remain
competitive	 in	 their	 market.	 Ultimately,	 all	 bills	 end	 up	 being	 paid	 by	 the
shareholders	of	the	company.	That	is	why	we	only	want	PPE	that	can	produce
revenue,	not	PPE	for	the	sake	of	owning	a	lot	of	assets.

_Patents,	trademarks	and	other	intangibles	(10	-	Asset	Column)_


Companies	 with	 strong	 brand	 names	 and	 efficient	 research	 and	 development
departments	are	likely	to	carry	trademarks	and	patents.	Coca-Cola	is	a	case	in
point.

The	 various	 expenses	 incurred	 by	 Coca-Cola	 in	 relation	 to	 a	 new	 soft	 drinks
recipe	would	go	on	the	balance	sheet	in	this	category.	Due	to	accounting	law,	a
company	can	list	all	expenses	from	research	and	development	as	an	intangible
asset.	This	means	that	all	the	material	and	labor	costs	that	Coca-Cola	incurs	in
relation	to	producing	the	recipe	can	now	be	transformed	into	an	asset.

Okay,	let’s	just	stop	there	for	a	minute.	Can	it	really	be	true	that	if	Coca-Cola
has	 very	 inefficient	 personnel	 and	 high	 salaries,	 this	 would	 ultimately	 be
transformed	into	a	bigger	asset?	It	may	sound	strange,	but	that’s	how	it	works.
This	process	is	called	capitalization.

Before	you	start	thinking	that	accounting	is	completely	corrupt,	let	me	explain
this	further.	As	with	all	other	assets,	intangibles	should	always	be	shown	on	the
balance	sheet	at	the	most	appropriate	value.	Capitalization	is	how	intangibles
like	patents	and	trademarks	are	entered	into	the	balance	sheet.	Just	as	tangible
assets	get	depreciated,	intangible	assets	also	lose	value	if	it	is	deemed	that	they
cannot	 generate	 income.	 When	 intangible	 assets	 are	 depreciated,	 it’s	 called
amortization.

This	is	a	very	important	category	and	one	that	Warren	Buffett	pays	particular
attention	 to.	 Since	 patents	 and	 trademarks	 provide	 a	 durable	 competitive
advantage	for	a	company,	it	is	a	great	source	of	risk	reduction.	Additionally,
intangible	assets	are	generally	unaffected	by	inflation.	This	means	that	as	time
marches	 on,	 the	 value	 of	 patents	 and	 trademarks	 increase	 in	 nominal	 dollars
automatically.

_Goodwill	(11	-	Asset	Column)_

Goodwill	is	also	an	intangible	asset.	 _Intangible_ 	means	that	it	is	something	we
cannot	touch.	So	let’s	see	how	goodwill	occurs.	Say	that	Coca-Cola	decides	to
acquire	a	subsidiary	(or	smaller	business)	for	$200,000	and	the	book	value	of	the
newly	 acquired	 company	 is	 only	 $150,000.	 In	 this	 case,	 $50,000	 would	 be
entered	under	the	non-current	assets	section	as	 _goodwill_.

Then	you	might	ask	why	Coca-Cola	wants	to	pay	more	than	the	book	value	for	a
subsidiary.	 Well,	 in	 business	 there	 is	 typically	 one	 answer	 to	 all	 business
decisions:	 decisions	 are	 made	 because	 they	 are	 expected	 to	 generate	 more
money!	So	Coca-Cola	believes	that	the	newly	acquired	subsidiary	can	generate


at	least	the	income	that	has	been	paid	($200,000)	over	a	certain	amount	of	time.
At	the	end	of	the	day,	the	value	of	an	asset	isn’t	the	book	value;	it’s	the	money
the	asset	can	return	to	the	investor	over	time.

Goodwill	 is	 often	 mistakenly	 thought	 to	 be	 internally	 generated.	 A	 typical
mistake	would	be	to	conclude	that	the	goodwill	Coca-Cola	has	on	their	balance
sheet	has	been	internally	decided	based	on	a	strong	brand.	Goodwill	only	occurs
during	the	acquisition	process;	it	is	not	something	that	the	company	can	create
by	themselves.

_Total	non-current	assets	(12	-	Asset	Column)_

Adding	up	all	the	assets	that	are	expected	to	be	turned	into	cash,	but	not	within
the	next	twelve	months,	you	have	the	total	non-current	assets.	This	would	be	the
summation	of	lines	7-11	in	the	asset	column.

_Total	assets	(13	-	Asset	Column)_

This	is	the	summation	of	both	the	current	assets	(line	6)	and	non-current	assets
(line	12).	In	essence,	this	represents	everything	that	is	expected	to	be	turned	into
cash	at	some	point	in	time—either	short	term	or	long	term.

##### Liabilities

As	said	many	times	already,	assets	are	what	the	company	owns.	They	can	either
be	financed	by	the	company’s	own	money	(equity)	or	by	someone	else’s	money
(liability).	So	here	we	are	again!	The	balance	sheet	is	perfectly	integrated—as	a
result,	you	cannot	say	 _assets_ 	without	thinking	about	 _liabilities	_ and _	equity_.

So	let’s	take	a	quick	look	at	the	liabilities.	After	all,	doesn’t	it	sound	tempting	to
use	other	people’s	money	to	buy	assets?

Like	the	difference	between	current	assets	and	non-current	assets,	liabilities	have
a	similar	approach	with	current	and	non-current	liabilities.	The	threshold	is	still
twelve	months.

An	obligation	is	a	current	liability	that	needs	to	be	paid	within	the	next	twelve
months.	Again,	I	will	present	the	liabilities	in	the	order	of	liquidity,	starting	with
most	liquid	first.

**Current	liabilities**

Let	us	now	take	a	look	at	the	current	liabilities.	These	are	the	obligations	that
need	to	be	paid	within	the	next	twelve	months.

_Accounts	payable	(1—Liability/Equity	Column)_


This	 account	 is	 sometimes	 referred	 to	 as	 _payables,	 net	 payables_ or	 _trade
payables_ .	Since	this	account	is	primarily	a	category	that	summarizes	what	the
business	has	bought	on	credit,	I	stick	to	the	name	 _accounts	payable._

As	 you	 may	 recall,	 we	 have	 an	 account	 in	 the	 balance	 sheet	 called	 _accounts
receivable_ .	 _Accounts	 payable_ is	 the	 complete	 opposite	 of	 that.	 Imagine	 that
Coca-Cola	 buys	 sugar	 for	 $1,000	 from	 a	 supplier.	 If	 the	 supplier	 requires
payment	within	90	days	(NET	90),	and	Coca-Cola	hasn’t	made	a	payment	yet,
then	the	accounts	payable	will	be	$1,000.

In	general,	you	should	not	mind	having	accounts	payable.	“Why?”	you	might
ask.	Wouldn’t	it	be	better	to	pay	off	what	we	owe	right	away?	I	can	perfectly	see
the	argument,	and	most	people	prefer	not	to	owe	money	to	another	party	in	the
future;	however,	for	a	company,	it	is	very	neat	to	have	an	interest-free	loan.	If
Coca-Cola	does	not	have	to	pay	for	their	sugar	in	the	next	ninety	days,	they	can
put	that	money	to	use	somewhere	else.

_Notes	payable	(2—Liability/Equity	Column)_

This	line	is	sometimes	referred	to	as	 _current	borrowing_ 	or	 _current	financial	debt_.
This	 line	 represents	 how	 much	 of	 the	 outstanding	 short-term	 debts	 should	 be
paid	back	to	the	issuer.

Let’s	say	that	Coca-Cola	takes	on	a	debt	of	a	$1,000.	Over	the	next	ten	years,
Coca-Cola	will	pay	back	$100	of	principal	to	the	bank.	In	this	case,	$100,	which
is	the	payment	for	the	first	year,	would	be	shown	in	this	line.

_Accrued	expenses	(3—Liability/Equity	Column)_

Often,	companies	will	incur	expenses	that	are	not	yet	paid	for.	For	Coca-Cola,
this	could	be	expenses	for	employees’	salaries,	electricity	bills,	or	basically	any
payment	that	is	consumed	but	not	yet	paid.	You	can	also	think	of	this	as	the
opposite	of	prepaid	expenses.

Any	portion	of	the	bill	that	has	not	been	paid	at	the	balance	sheet	date	would	be
classified	as	 _accrued	expenses._

_Taxes	payable	(4—Liability/Equity	Column)_

As	an	individual	person	working	for	a	company,	you	have	the	“luxury”	of	the
federal	and	state	government	automatically	withdrawing	a	portion	of	your	salary
to	account	for	taxes.	The	government	might	withhold	30%	of	your	pay.	At	the
end	 of	 the	 year,	 you	 file	 your	 tax	 return,	 and	 tell	 the	 government	 what	 you
actually	made	for	the	year.	If	the	government	automatically	withdrew	too	much


of	your	salary,	you	get	a	tax	return.	If	not,	you’ll	write	a	check	for	the	difference.
In	 corporate	 accounting,	 taxes	 work	 the	 same	 way,	 only	 the	 _company_ is
responsible	for	withholding	the	taxes	it	owes—it	doesn’t	happen	automatically.
As	a	result,	that’s	what	the	“Taxes	payable”	account	is	for—a	holding	pattern	for
the	corporate	taxes.	This	is	the	location	where	the	company	will	list	the	money
that	 they	 owe	 to	 the	 federal,	 state,	 or	 local	 government	 for	 the	 products	 or
services	they	sell.	Once	the	payment	is	made	to	the	government	from	the	cash
account,	 you’ll	 see	 a	 deduction	 in	 the	 Taxes	 Payable	 account	 and	 the	 tax
payment	will	then	be	listed	on	the	income	statement.

_Total	current	liabilities	(5—Liability/Equity	Column)_

Add	up	all	obligations	you	expect	to	pay	in	cash	during	the	next	twelve	months
and	you	will	have	the	total	current	liabilities	for	Coca-Cola.	This	would	be	the
summation	of	lines	1-4	in	the	liability/equity	column.

**Non-current	liabilities**

Sometimes	non-current	liabilities	are	referred	to	as	 _long-term	liabilities_ .	As	you
might	 expect,	 long-term	 liabilities	 are	 anything	 the	 company	 expects	 to	 pay
outside	the	12-month	timeframe.

_Provisions	(6—Liability/Equity	Column)_

In	a	perfect	world,	everyone	would	always	pay	what	they	owe.	Unfortunately,
this	is	not	always	the	case.	Companies	know	this,	so	when	a	company	sells	on
credit,	they	expect	some	of	their	customers	to	default	from	time	to	time.

For	this	reason,	companies	have	a	 _provisions	account_ 	where	they	continually	put
money	aside	to	absorb	these	potential	losses.	Coca-Cola	makes	a	lot	of	deals
with	different	retailers.	Say	that	Coca-Cola	estimates	that	2%	of	these	customers
will	 default	 on	 payments.	 That	 means	 that	 every	 time	 Coca-Cola	 sells	 $100
worth	of	product,	they	would	expect	retailers	to	default	on	$2	of	those	sales.	For
this	reason,	they	may	put	$2	into	a	separate	account—called	provisions.

That	is	not	the	same	as	saying	that	customers	will	always	default.	It	is	merely	an
estimate	for	the	long	run.	If	Coca-Cola	has	revenue	one	year	of	$100	and	no
customers	default,	well,	that’s	great	for	Coca-Cola—they	would	still	have	$2	set
aside	for	when	times	are	bad.	The	next	year,	a	customer	who	accounted	for	$4
revenue	 defaults.	 No	 problem!	 Since	 Coca-Cola	 has	 set	 $2	 aside	 for	 the	 first
year,	and	also	set	aside	$2	for	the	following	year,	this	will	not	affect	the	income
statement.	It	has	already	been	accounted	for.

You	may	well	feel	that	provisions	are	not	always	perfectly	matched.	You	are


correct.	That	is	why	you	will	often	see	that	the	provisions	account	fluctuates
from	year	to	year.	If	it	turns	out	that	the	average	estimate	of,	say,	2%	is	too	much
or	too	little,	companies	simply	adjust	continually.

_Long-term	debt	(7—Liability/Equity	Column)_

This	is	very	often	the	most	significant	line	in	the	non-current	liabilities	section	of
the	 balance	 sheet.	 These	 are	 simply	 loans	 that	 have	 been	 obtained	 by	 the
company.	The	simplest	way	to	look	at	this	is	to	think	of	it	like	a	bank	loan.	So
imagine	that	Coca-Cola	borrows	$1,000	from	the	bank,	with	an	agreement	that
Coke	will	return	payment	within	five	years.	In	this	simple	example,	the	long-
term	debt	account	would	simply	be	recorded	as	$1,000	on	Coca-Cola’s	balance
sheet.

Debt	 is	 a	 very	 popular	 way	 of	 financing	 one’s	 business.	 When	 Coca-Cola
obtains	loans,	creditors	have	no	influence	on	the	daily	operations.	Creditors	are
foremost	interested	in	getting	their	money	back,	preferably	with	a	lot	of	interest.
But	the	daily	business	decisions	are	usually	completely	up	to	the	management
and	shareholders.

When	you	think	of	long-term	debt,	you	might	think	that	it	is	money	that’s	owed
back.	Perhaps	surprisingly,	long-term	debt	does	not	always	have	to	be	paid	back
—and	what	is	even	better	is	that	the	bank	does	not	mind	in	most	cases!	Yes,	you
heard	right.	Think	of	it	like	owning	a	home.	Say	that	it	costs	$300,000	and	you
have	made	a	down	payment	of	$60,000,	borrowing	the	remainder	from	the	bank.
Do	you	intend	to	pay	$240,000	back	to	the	bank?	Well,	there	is	surely	good
reason	to	bring	some	of	the	debt	down,	but	there	is	actually	no	reason	to	pay
back	your	whole	loan—especially	if	the	interest	rate	is	under	the	inflation	rate.
As	 long	 as	 you	 feel	 that	 you	 have	 sufficient	 equity	 in	 your	 home,	 then	 you
should	be	fine	using	your	money	for	something	else.	The	bank	is	usually	pleased
to	be	receiving	interest	payments	on	your	home,	as	long	as	you	do	not	default	on
the	payment.

The	situation	is	exactly	the	same	for	long-term	debt	of	a	company.	Let’s	say	that
Coca-Cola	takes	on	a	little	debt	at	an	interest	rate	of	4%.	As	long	as	Coca-Cola
can	make	a	better	return	in	the	market	and	can	control	the	risk,	they	may	choose
to	delay	the	repayment	of	the	principal	to	seek	larger	returns	elsewhere.	If	the
company	decides	to	pay	off	the	loan,	it	would	be	similar	to	getting	a	4%	return
(accounting	 for	 inflation,	 it	 might	 even	 be	 as	 low	 as	 1%,	 effectively).	 An
efficient	company	could	probably	get	a	better	return	by	investing	in	new	assets.


That	is	not	the	same	as	saying	that	debt	is	always	a	good	thing.	It	is	a	thin	line,
but	often	even	the	best-run	companies	in	the	world	have	taken	on	some	debt.
The	important	thing	is	that	it	is	under	control.	The	metric	for	determining	this
coverage	 has	 already	 been	 discussed	 with	 the	 interest	 coverage	 ratio	 and	 the
debt-to-equity	ratio.

_Deferred	tax	(8—Liability/Equity	Column)_

Deferred	tax	can	be	a	tricky	subject	to	comprehend	if	you’re	not	familiar	with
corporate	tax	laws.	It	can	be	listed	as	an	asset	or	a	liability	depending	on	what
year	a	particular	item	is	being	depreciated	and	what	the	company	has	decided	to
realize	as	a	loss	or	gain.

Let’s	provide	a	basic	example	to	demonstrate	how	this	works.	Let’s	say	Coca-
Cola	bought	a	car	for	the	price	of	$10,000.	It	is	to	be	depreciated	over	a	five-year
period,	 meaning	 that	 the	 accounting	 expense	 for	 the	 car	 is	 $2,000	 per	 year
($10,000/5).	 Now,	 tax	 laws	 allow	 you	 to	 use	 a	 thing	 called	 accelerated
depreciation	in	order	to	represent	the	actual	depreciation	more	accurately.	This
may	result	in	a	steeper	depreciation	early	on,	but	a	more	gradual	depreciation
later	in	the	item’s	lifecycle.	So,	from	an	accelerated	depreciation	standpoint,	let’s
say	that	Coca-Cola	can	write	off	25%	of	the	previous	year’s	value.	That	means
the	 first	 year’s	 tax	 expense	 would	 be	 $2,500	 ($10,000*25%),	 but	 the	 second
year’s	would	be	$1,875	($7,500	*	25%),	and	so	on.

A	 deferred	 tax	 occurs	 when	 there	 is	 a	 difference	 between	 the	 linear	 and
accelerated	depreciation	approach.	Looking	at	the	figure	below,	you	can	see	the
accounting	value	on	the	first	row	(linear	depreciation)	and	the	tax	value	on	the
second	row	(accelerated	depreciation).	The	difference	between	the	two	values	is
on	 the	 third	 row.	 In	 order	 to	 calculate	 the	 deferred	 tax,	 you	 multiply	 the
differences	by	the	corresponding	tax	bracket	the	company	is	in	for	that	particular
year.	For	the	example	below,	I	assumed	the	company	was	in	a	35%	tax	structure
for	all	the	years.

```
Purchase Year	1 Year	2 Year	3
Accounting	Value 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000
Tax	Value 10,000 7,500 5,625 4,219
```
```
Taxable	Difference
```
###### -

```
500 375 (219)
```

```
Deferred	Tax	Liability	@	35%
```
###### -

```
175 131 (77)
```
So	what	does	all	this	mean?	In	essence,	the	tax	liability	corrects	the	amount	of
taxes	a	company	should	or	shouldn’t	have	paid.	When	you	look	at	year	1,	the
company	 should	 have	 depreciated	 the	 vehicle	 by	 $2,000	 according	 to	 its
accounting	book	value.	Instead	the	company	depreciated	the	car	by	$2,500.	As	a
result,	the	company	has	reduced	its	earnings	for	that	year	by	$500	more	than	it
should	have.	This	means	they	will	pay	less	tax	than	they	should	have.	How	much
less?	 Well,	 based	 on	 the	 company’s	 tax	 bracket,	 they	 should	 have	 paid	 $175
more.	Now,	let’s	look	at	year	3.	When	we	look	at	this	year,	you’ll	notice	that	at
this	point,	the	company	has	actually	overpaid	their	cumulative	taxes	by	$77.	It	is
very	important	to	realize	that	the	deferred	tax	is	only	applicable	for	the	year	of
consideration.	 Therefore,	 if	 the	 car	 were	 sold	 in	 the	 third	 year,	 the	 company
would	have	a	deferred	tax	asset	of	$77—the	tax	liability	during	year	1	and	year	2
is	already	factored	into	the	$77	figure.	This	$77	deferred	tax	asset	would	reduce
the	 company’s	 taxable	 income,	 if	 the	 vehicle	 were	 sold	 during	 that	 year’s
income	 statement.	 Once	 this	 asset	 is	 realized	 onto	 the	 income	 statement,	 the
amount	listed	on	the	balance	sheet	(the	$77)	will	disappear.

_Total	non-current	liabilities	(9—Liability/Equity	Column)_

Adding	up	all	the	obligations	that	have	to	be	paid	in	cash,	but	not	within	the	next
twelve	months,	gives	you	Coca-Cola’s	non-current	liabilities.

_Total	liabilities	(10—Liability/Equity	Column)_

As	you	might	expect,	this	number	is	very	straightforward.	It’s	the	summation	of
lines	5	and	9	on	the	liability/equity	column,	which	combines	current	liabilities
and	non-current	liabilities.

##### Equity

Assets,	as	you	will	remember,	are	either	financed	by	our	own	money	(equity)	or
by	someone	else’s	money	(liabilities).	As	such,	you	could	say	that	the	company
does	 not	 own	 anything.	 When	 you	 own	 a	 share,	 you	 own	 a	 part	 of	 a	 real
company.	That	is	why	you	find	equity	grouped	together	with	liabilities.	Equity	is
a	form	of	liability.	It	is	what	the	company	owes	to	the	owners	of	the	company.
So,	 just	 to	 make	 things	 clear:	 Coca-Cola	 does	 not	 own	 anything—it	 is	 the
shareholders	of	Coca-Cola	who	own	all	the	company’s	assets.

With	this	in	mind,	let’s	begin	to	dig	into	each	line	of	equity.


**Share	capital	(11—Liability/Equity	Column):**

This	line	is	often	referred	to	as	 _capital	stock_ ,	 _common	stock,	or	paid-in	capital_.
This	is	a	section	that	often	confuses	many	investors.	The	share	capital	is	simply
used	 to	 keep	 track	 of	 common	 stock	 splits	 and	 common	 shares	 outstanding.
When	a	company	is	originally	started,	the	founder(s)	place	a	certain	amount	of
money	into	an	equity	account	called	 _paid-in	capital_ .	The	owners	use	that	money
as	 a	 representation	 of	 the	 shares	 outstanding.	 For	 example,	 if	 the	 company
wanted	to	issue	100	common	shares	of	the	company,	they	might	put	$100	dollars
into	 this	 account	 and	 say	 each	 common	 share	 has	 a	 par	 value	 of	 $1.00.	 The
interesting	 point	 about	 this	 action	 is	 that	 it	 doesn’t	 matter	 what	 amount	 the
company	wants	to	use	as	the	starting	point.	If	the	company	wanted	to	put	$1.00
into	the	Share	Capital	account	and	still	issue	100	common	shares,	they	could	do
that	too.	In	that	case,	the	par	value	on	each	share	would	be	one	cent.	Regardless
of	the	initial	designation	of	how	much	one	share’s	par	value	is,	the	share	capital
account	is	a	tracking	tool	for	future	splits	and	share	growth/contraction.

To	demonstrate	my	point,	let’s	say	this	new	company	has	$100	in	their	share
capital	account.	If	they	have	100	shares	issued,	each	common	share	has	a	par
value	of	$1.00.	Let’s	also	assume	this	company	has	had	a	lot	of	success	through
the	 years.	 As	 a	 result,	 the	 company’s	 stock	 price,	 or	 market	 price,	 has
skyrocketed	to	$500	a	share.	Remember,	this	is	the	market	price,	not	the	par
value.	 Although	 the	 market	 price	 has	 gone	 up,	 the	 par	 value	 of	 the	 common
stock	remains	unchanged.	As	the	company	continues	to	grow,	they	are	looking
to	raise	additional	funding	for	future	acquisitions.	In	order	to	raise	this	money,
the	company	decides	to	issue	100	more	shares	outstanding.	Before	the	company
can	issue	the	new	shares,	they	need	to	check	the	corporate	charter	to	determine
the	allowable	number	of	shares	outstanding;	for	example,	the	charter	might	show
that	the	company	has	a	limit	of	issuing	500	common	shares	outstanding.

Many	balance	sheets	show	this	number	in	the	share	capital	line	of	accounting.	It
might	say,”	500	shares	authorized,	100	shares	issued.”	Now	that	we	know	the
company’s	charter	supports	the	new	issue	of	common	stock,	the	company	can
issue	more	shares.

In	order	to	do	this,	the	company	would	need	to	put	an	additional	$100	into	the
Share	 Capital	 account	 to	 issue	 100	 more	 common	 shares	 (remember,	 the	 par
value	 is	 $1.00).	 Now,	 the	 shares	 might	 sell	 on	 the	 open	 market	 for	 $500,
therefore	raising	money	for	the	company,	but	that	doesn’t	preclude	the	company
from	tracking	the	new	number	of	shares	in	the	capital	account.	At	the	end	of	this


action,	 there	 would	 be	 $200	 in	 the	 capital	 account	 and	 200	 shares	 would	 be
outstanding.

Now	for	the	twist.	Let’s	say	the	company	wanted	to	conduct	a	stock	split.	In	this
case,	the	company	would	double	their	shares	outstanding	again;	for	example,	the
company	 would	 issue	 another	 200	 shares—one	 share	 to	 each	 existing
shareholder.	 During	 a	 stock	 split,	 the	 company’s	 intention	 is	 to	 reduce	 the
market	price	of	each	share.	During	a	stock	split,	the	company	isn’t	wanting	to
raise	additional	funding;	instead	they	are	trying	to	lower	the	current	market	price
of	each	share	so	more	people	can	trade	the	stock.	To	conduct	the	stock	split,	the
company	 simply	 issues	 an	 additional	 share	 to	 each	 outstanding	 share	 on	 the
market.	Since	the	distribution	is	equal	across	all	owners	(relative	to	the	number
of	shares	they	own),	the	impact	to	the	value	of	each	owner	is	unchanged.	With
respect	to	the	capital	stock	account,	only	a	small	change	is	made.	The	line	would
now	say,	“500	shares	authorized,	400	shares	issued.”	The	capital	account	would
remain	 at	 $200,	 but	 the	 par	 value	 per	 share	 would	 now	 be	 $0.50.	 (400
shares/$200	=	$0.50).

As	you	can	see,	the	par	value	of	common	stock	is	nothing	more	than	a	tracking
tool.	It	allows	owners	the	ability	to	determine	stock	splits	and/or	repurchases.
Most	capital	accounts	use	a	penny	or	less	to	represent	each	outstanding	share.

**Additional	paid-in	capital	(12—Liability/Equity	Column):**

Contrary	 to	 the	 share	 capital,	 additional	 paid-in	 capital	 typically	 has	 a	 much
higher	value	when	you	look	at	the	balance	sheet.	The	reason	for	this	is	simple.
Imagine	again	that	Coca-Cola	has	100	shares	with	a	par	value	of	$1	each.	Let’s
assume	they	want	to	raise	more	money	by	offering	more	shares	onto	the	open
market.	Let’s	also	assume	that	the	company	can	sell	each	share	for	$50	on	the
market.	 If	 the	 company	 sustains	 a	 par	 value	 of	 $1	 for	 each	 additional	 share
issued,	the	paid-in	capital	account	would	have	$4,900	in	it	($50*100	-	$1*100	=
$4,900).	 As	 you	 can	 derive	 from	 the	 calculation,	 additional	 paid-in	 capital	 is
therefore	 the	 difference	 between	 the	 proceeds	 for	 the	 issue	 of	 the	 stock
subtracted	by	the	par	value.

You	 might	 wonder	 why	 investors	 pay	 such	 a	 high	 price	 over	 the	 share’s	 par
value.	 That	 is	 a	 completely	 legitimate	 question	 to	 ask.	 The	 answer	 is	 very
simple:	the	actual	share	price	of	Coca-Cola	has	nothing	to	do	with	the	par	value.
Par	 value	 on	 common	 stock	 is	 merely	 used	 for	 bookkeeping	 purposes	 (as
previously	mentioned).	If	you	value	a	stock	to	be	worth	$50,	you	should	not	care
the	least	bit	about	the	par	value.


**Retained	earnings	(13—Liability/Equity	Column):**

The	retained	earnings	are	the	sum	of	all	the	previous	net	incomes	the	company
has	produced.	Let	me	give	you	an	example.

Say	that	Coca-Cola	has	made	a	profit	of	$100	for	the	first	year	of	business.	If	no
dividend	payments	were	made,	then	$100	would	go	from	the	net	income	(on	the
income	statement)	to	the	retained	earnings	(on	the	balance	sheet).	Now	imagine
that	Coca-Cola	makes	a	profit	of	$150	the	next	year.	Well,	again,	given	that
there	 are	 no	 dividend	 payments,	 you	 would	 now	 have	 a	 retained	 earnings
account	 in	 the	 business	 of	 $250	 ($100+$150).	 We	 have	 now	 experienced	 an
increase	in	Coca-Cola’s	equity.	Does	that	mean	that	Coca-Cola	now	owns	$250
more?	Nonsense!	Coca-Cola’s	shareholders	now	own	$250	more,	and,	as	you
will	recall,	equity	is	simply	just	the	liability	the	company	owes	the	owners.

So	 far,	 we	 have	 not	 considered	 dividend	 payments.	 But	 say	 that	 Coca-Cola
decided	 to	 pay	 out	 $25	 in	 dividends	 to	 the	 owners	 after	 year	 two.	 Now	 the
retained	earnings	account	would	be	$225	($100+$150-$25).	That	also	means	that
when	you	look	at	the	retained	earnings	line,	you	should	not	only	look	at	how
much	the	line	is	growing;	you	should	also	consider	how	much	of	a	dividend	is
being	paid	out	to	the	owners.	Paying	a	dividend	is	simply	one	method	to	return
money	to	the	shareholders.

Does	this	also	mean	that	all	the	money	at	the	retained	earnings	can	be	paid	out	to
the	owners?	Let’s	take	a	look	at	the	balance	sheet	for	our	generic	example.	If	this
was	for	Coca-Cola,	we	could	see	that	there	are	retained	earnings	of	$15,590	in
the	company.

However,	only	cash	of	$1,847	can	be	paid	out	to	investors.	So	where	did	all	the
money	 go	 that	 Coca-Cola	 has	 made	 during	 the	 years?	 The	 majority	 of	 that
money	has	been	reemployed	in	the	business.	If	this	balance	sheet	was	for	Coca-
Cola,	it	could	have	been	employed	in	the	inventory	for	buying	more	sugar	or	in	a
new	building	for	the	headquarters.	Basically,	these	are	the	assets	that	you	see	in
the	balance	sheet.

Capital	is	reemployed	by	the	company	to	create	even	more	money	in	the	future.
As	an	investor,	you	should	be	pleased	to	see	that	capital	is	being	reemployed	in
new	assets	(assuming	the	company	has	a	high	return	on	equity,	ROE).

**Treasury	stock	(14—Liability/Equity	Column):**

If	there	is	one	line	that	puzzles	investors,	it	is	the	treasury	stock.	One	reason	for
this	is	that	it	is	a	 _contra	account_ .	Basically	you	just	need	to	think	of	everything


you	just	learned—and	do	the	opposite!	It	is	not	surprising	that	many	investors
get	confused.

Say	 that	 Coca-Cola	 makes	 a	 profit	 of	 $100	 and	 decides	 to	 buy	 some	 of	 the
outstanding	 shares	 off	 the	 open	 market.	 This	 means	 that	 if	 you	 were	 a
shareholder	in	Coca-Cola,	and	you	sold	some	of	your	shares,	the	sale	might	have
been	back	to	the	company	itself.	Why	would	Coca-Cola	buy	its	own	shares?
Well,	imagine	that	there	are	one	hundred	Coca-Cola	shares	and	the	share	price	is
$50.	If	Coca-Cola	made	a	profit	of	$100	and	spent	the	entire	profit	on	buying
back	shares,	the	company	would	be	able	to	buy	back	two	shares.

In	other	words,	there	were	originally	one	hundred	shares	outstanding,	but	now
there	are	only	ninety-eight	(100-2).	If	I	own	one	of	the	remaining	98	shares	in
Coca-Cola,	I	would	now	own	a	larger	part	of	the	company.	Before,	I	owned
1/100	 of	 Coca-Cola,	 but	 after	 the	 share	 buy-back	 I	 now	 own	 1/98	 of	 the
company.	I	am	quite	pleased	with	this	because	it	also	means	that	next	year,	if	the
profit	is	still	$100,	my	part	of	the	earnings	would	no	longer	be	$1	($100/100)	but
$1.02	($100/98).	Let	me	illustrate	this:


The	reason	it	may	still	be	a	little	confusing	is	that	the	share	buy-back	Coca-Cola
makes	will	be	shown	as	a	 _negative_ 	number	in	the	equity.	So	if	Coca-Cola	makes
a	profit	of	$100	for	a	given	year	and	all	the	money	is	spent	on	share	buy-backs,
the	equity	for	the	whole	company	remains	the	same	in	accounting	terms	(just
like	it	did	in	the	example	above	for	the	entire	company—left	column).

As	an	investor,	you	should	keep	a	close	eye	on	the	treasury	stock	account.	The
number	you	see	in	the	treasury	stock	is	the	price	the	company	paid	to	purchase
each	share.	In	our	generic	example,	the	treasury	stock	is	-$853.	This	means	that
Coca-Cola	has	spent	$853	from	the	profit	to	buy	back	its	own	shares.

It’s	important	to	note	that	the	amount	listed	in	the	treasury	account	is	based	on
previous	market	prices	when	the	repurchase	transactions	occurred.	For	example,


the	company	might	have	bought	10	shares	at	$10	last	month	and	5	shares	at	$20
this	month.	The	treasury	account	would	have	-$200	listed,	and	only	15	shares
were	repurchased;	therefore,	the	average	purchase	price	per	share	was	$13.33
over	the	period	of	the	account	activity.	Treasury	stocks	are	interesting	because
the	 management	 can	 choose	 to	 issue	 the	 stocks	 into	 the	 market	 again	 if	 they
would	like.

As	an	investor,	you	should	include	treasury	stock	when	you	evaluate	how	the
company	has	grown	its	equity	per	share	(or	book	value).	Again,	remember	that
equity	is	really	the	owners’	money,	so	by	including	the	treasury	stock	you	can
see	how	much	the	company	has	been	able	to	grow	the	owners’	money.	At	quick
glance,	an	investor	might	think	that	a	company	has	only	grown	their	book	value
(or	 equity	 per	 share)	 by	 a	 small	 margin—say	 3%	 annual.	 This	 may	 be	 very
misleading	 if	 the	 treasury	 account	 isn’t	 included	 in	 that	 assessment.	 If	 a
substantial	 growth	 in	 the	 treasury	 account	 had	 occurred	 during	 the	 period	 of
assessment,	 it	 may	 drastically	 increase	 the	 book	 value	 growth—which
potentially	 can	 be	 used	 to	 measure	 free	 cash	 flow.	 In	 the	 Appendix,	 I	 have
elaborated	 more	 on	 the	 treasury	 stock	 account	 and	 how	 to	 prepare	 for	 this
discrepancy	in	your	stock’s	valuation.

**Total	equity	(15—Liability/Equity	Column)**

All	that	Coca-Cola	owes	to	the	company’s	shareholders	is	included	in	the	total
equity.	One	way	of	looking	at	this	line	is	to	realize	that	this	is	what	would	be	left
to	the	shareholders	if	all	assets	were	liquidated	and	liabilities	were	paid	right
now.

**Total	liabilities	and	equity	(16—Liability/Equity	Column)**

This	line	is	composed	of	all	that	Coca-Cola	owes	to	both	the	shareholders	and
the	lenders.	Total	liabilities	and	equity	are	always	equal	to	the	total	assets.


##### Ratio	analysis	for	the	balance	sheet

Just	as	we	did	a	key	ratio	analysis	for	the	income	statement,	we	will	now	carry
out	a	ratio	analysis	based	on	the	balance	sheet.	Since	we	also	know	the	income
statement,	some	of	the	key	ratio	analysis	will	be	based	on	both	statements.

When	performing	a	key	ratio	analysis,	start	by	looking	at	a	single	year.	Once	you
get	the	hang	of	it,	you’ll	definitely	want	to	compare	ratios	over	a	five-to	ten-year
period.	Also,	you’ll	want	to	compare	ratios	across	your	company’s	competitors.

To	give	you	the	best	possible	overview	before	we	begin	the	key	ratio	analysis,	I
have	 inserted	 both	 the	 income	 statement	 and	 the	 balance	 sheet	 for	 your
reference.

**Profitability	ratios**

**Return	on	equity:**

The	 first—and	 most	 important—key	 ratio	 we	 should	 look	 at	 is	 the	 return	 on
equity,	often	abbreviated	as	ROE.	The	formula	looks	like	this:

```
Return	on	Equity	=	Net	Income	/	Equity
```

###### 2,863	/	18,398	=	15.6%

Net	Income	is	found	on	the	Income	Statement	(line	13)

Equity	is	found	on	the	liability	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	15)

ROE	simply	tells	us	how	much	the	company	has	been	able	to	grow	the	owners’
money	 during	 the	 year.	 So	 if	 the	 ROE	 for	 Coca-Cola	 is	 15.6%,	 we	 could
conclude	that	Coca-Cola	has	made	a	return	of	$15.6	for	every	$100	the	company
has	retained	from	previous	earnings	or	initial	investments.

For	this	reason,	we	want	this	number	to	be	as	high	as	possible.	As	with	all	key
ratio	analyses,	it	is	hard	to	put	a	benchmark	on	a	sufficient	ROE.	With	that	said,
you	will	often	see	that	good	companies	have	a	consistent	ROE	of	above	8%.

ROE	is	a	very	important	key	ratio	to	look	at	if	you	are	serious	about	investing.
You	can	read	more	about	ROE	in	Chapter	4,	Principle	1,	Rule	3.

**Return	on	assets:**

This	ratio	is	also	very	often	abbreviated	as	ROA.	Sometimes	it	is	also	called
_return	on	investment_ 	which	is	why	you	sometimes	see	this	key	ratio	abbreviated
as	ROI.	Nonetheless,	the	formula	is	the	same	and	it	looks	like	this:

```
Return	on	Assets	=	Net	Income	/	Total	Assets
2,863	/	27,086	=	10.6%
```
Net	Income	is	found	on	the	Income	Statement	(line	6)

Total	Assets	is	found	on	the	asset	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	13)

Now	this	ratio	isn’t	that	important	to	calculate	if	you’re	buying	a	company	with
very	little	debt.	In	fact	if	the	company	had	no	debt,	the	ROA	and	ROE	would	be
the	 exact	 same	 number.	 As	 a	 result,	 if	 you’re	 buying	 a	 company	 with	 a	 low
debt/equity	ratio	(like	0.50	or	less),	you	can	probably	skip	this	calculation.	On
the	other	hand,	if	you’re	buying	a	company	with	a	lot	of	debt,	you’ll	probably
want	to	use	the	ROA	instead	of	the	ROE.	If	you’re	curious	as	to	how	it	works,
here’s	a	simple	explanation.

For	 Coca-Cola,	 the	 ROA	 is	 10.6%.	 This	 means	 that	 all	 assets,	 ranging	 from
goodwill	to	the	inventory,	have	been	included.	Clearly	we	want	this	figure	to	be
as	high	as	possible,	since	we	want	to	get	the	highest	profit	comparison	to	our
assets.

ROA	will	always	be	lower	than	the	ROE	if	the	company	has	debt.	The	reason	is
very	simple.	Your	starting	point	(or	numerator	in	the	ratio)	is	the	same	net	profit,


but	the	difference	can	be	found	in	the	numbers	you	divide	the	numerator	by.

Your	assets	are	either	financed	by	your	money	(equity)	or	someone	else’s	money
(liabilities).	For	ROA,	you	are	dividing	by	the	total	assets.	Since	we	know	from
the	balance	sheet	that	assets	are	the	same	as	equity	+	liabilities,	it	should	be	easy
to	see	why	ROA	is	a	lower	number.	When	equity	is	combined	with	liabilities	in
the	 denominator,	 the	 ratio	 becomes	 smaller.	 As	 you	 can	 quickly	 see,	 if	 the
company	has	a	large	amount	of	debt,	the	denominator	will	become	very	large
and	the	ROA	will	be	very	small.

Personally,	I	like	to	see	a	ROA	of	above	6%,	but	most	importantly	I	want	to	see
that	my	stock	picks	are	doing	better	than	their	competitors.	This	means	that	I
would	be	more	focused	on	whether	Coca-Cola	had	a	higher	ROA	than	Pepsi,
rather	than	solely	looking	at	whether	ROA	is	above	6%.

**Liquidity	ratios**

**Current	ratio:**

Liquidity	 is	 important	 for	 all	 businesses.	 Without	 liquidity,	 even	 the	 most
profitable	company	will	go	bankrupt.	Let’s	take	a	look	at	the	formula:

```
Current	Ratio	=	Current	Assets	/	Current	Liabilities
9,153	/	3,962	=	2.31
```
Current	Assets	is	found	on	the	asset	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	6)

Current	Liabilities	is	found	on	the	liability	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	5)

Let	me	repeat	here	the	difference	between	current	assets	and	current	liabilities.	If
something	is	a	current	asset,	it	means	that	it	can	be	expected	to	be	converted	into
cash	within	a	period	of	twelve	months.	Examples	would	include	inventory	and
accounts	receivables.

A	current	liability,	on	the	other	hand,	is	something	that	we	expect	to	pay	with
cash	within	the	next	twelve	months.	If	we	again	turn	to	the	balance	sheet	figures,
examples	of	this	could	be	taxes	payable	or	accounts	payable.

So	 what	 this	 key	 ratio	 does	 is	 compare	 the	 company’s	 expectation	 for	 cash
inflow	 (current	 assets)	 and	 cash	 outflow	 (current	 liabilities)	 during	 the	 next
twelve	months.	As	investors,	our	threshold	for	a	current	ratio	is	that	it	should	be
above	1.0.	We	can	also	say	that	we	want	this	number	to	be	above	100%.	The
reason	for	this	is	that	if	we	do	not	get	more	money	in	than	out	within	the	next
twelve	months,	we	will	be	forced	to	take	on	debt	or	relinquish	more	equity	(a
fancy	way	of	saying	sell	more	stock	to	raise	money).	For	this	reason,	we	prefer


to	have	a	current	ratio	of	above	1,	or	even	1.5	to	be	safe.	As	shareholders	in
Coca-Cola,	we	would	therefore	be	pleased	to	see	a	current	ratio	of	2.31.

In	 general,	 you	 might	 say	 that	 we	 want	 as	 high	 a	 current	 ratio	 as	 possible;
however,	the	current	ratio	can	actually	be	too	high.	A	current	ratio	of	above	5
may	also	indicate	bad	money	management,	as	cash	could	be	put	to	better	use
elsewhere.

Warren	Buffett	himself	puts	a	lot	of	emphasis	on	the	current	ratio.	You	can	read
more	about	the	current	ratio	in	Chapter	4,	Principle	1,	Rule 2.

**Acid	test	ratio:**

Some	call	the	 _acid	test	ratio_ 	a	conservative	approach	to	the	 _current	ratio_ .	Others
refer	 to	 the	 acid	 test	 ratio	 as	 the	 _skeptic	 liquidity	 measure_ .	 Nonetheless,	 the
formula	for	the	acid	test	ratio	is	this:

```
Acid	Test	Ratio	=	(Current	Assets—Inventory)	/	Current	Liabilities
(9,153—2,486)	/	3,962	=	1.68
```
Current	Assets	is	found	on	the	asset	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	6)

Inventory	is	found	on	the	asset	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	3)

Current	Liabilities	is	found	on	the	liability	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	5)

As	 you	 can	 see	 from	 the	 formula,	 we	 are	 now	 quite	 conservative	 when
estimating	the	future	cash	inflow,	as	the	inventory	is	not	included	in	the	current
assets.	Let’s	perform	this	calculation	for	Coca-Cola.	To	do	so,	we	would	look	at
how	 much	 money	 Coca-Cola	 was	 expecting	 to	 receive	 and	 possess	 in	 cash
within	the	next	twelve	months—BUT	we	would	not	include	the	inventory.	This
means	that	we	assume	that	the	whole	inventory	of	soft	drinks	does	not	exist—
that’s	obviously	a	large	part	of	the	current	asset	value.

Next,	we	look	at	the	key	ratio	and	ask,	“Assuming	that	we	do	not	sell	anything
from	our	inventory,	do	we	still	expect	to	receive	more	in	than	we	need	to	pay	out
during	next	twelve	months?	In	this	situation,	the	answer	is	yes.	In	this	example,
Coca-Cola	would	expect	to	get	as	much	as	1.68	times	more	in-flow	of	cash	than
what	they	expect	to	pay	out	over	the	next	twelve	months.

If	you	are	a	very	conservative	investor,	this	key	ratio	is	for	you.	Just	as	for	the
current	ratio,	you	want	a	somewhat	high	value,	and	definitely	above	1	or	even
1.5.	I	would	say	that	the	less	you	know	about	the	company,	the	more	you	should
prefer	this	key	ratio	over	the	current	ratio.

**Efficiency	ratios**


**Inventory	turnover	ratio**

Every	 company	 likes	 to	 be	 efficient.	 And	 inventory	 turnover	 in	 particular	 is
something	that	the	management	puts	a	lot	of	focus	on.	Let’s	see	what	all	the	fuss
is	about.

```
Inventor	Turnover	Ratio	=	Cost	of	Revenue	/	Inventory
5,348	/	2,486	=	2.15
```
Cost	of	Revenue	is	found	on	the	Income	Statement	(line	2)

Inventory	is	found	on	the	asset	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	3)

If	 this	 calculation	 was	 based	 on	 Coca-Cola’s	 financial	 statements,	 we	 could
conclude	that	Coca-Cola	has	been	able	to	turn	over	their	whole	inventory	2.15
times	 during	 the	 year.	 As	 an	 investor,	 would	 you	 be	 satisfied	 with	 this?	 In
general	we	want	this	number	to	be	as	high	as	possible.

As	a	shareholder	in	Coca-Cola,	I	would	prefer	to	have	the	inventory	empty	and
filled	 4	 times	 instead	 of	 2.15.	 This	 would	 show	 that	 Coca-Cola	 was	 more
efficient	in	turning	the	inventory	into	sales.	A	can	of	Coke	is	probably	not	the
worst	 product	 to	 be	 stored	 in	 inventory—and	 for	 similar	 products	 with	 a
somewhat	long	duration,	a	low	inventory	turnover	can	sometimes	be	accepted.
For	 companies	 dealing	 with	 fresh	 food,	 you	 would	 get	 completely	 different
numbers.

In	all	circumstances,	capital	in	inventory	is	expensive,	and	for	products	with	a
somewhat	high	duration,	I	would	like	to	see	an	inventory	turnover	of	4	or	above.
With	 that	 in	 mind,	 I	 would	 rather	 take	 this	 as	 a	 rule	 of	 thumb	 and	 do	 more
research	to	understand	the	industry	standard.

```
Note:	It’s	very	important	to	remember	that	this	number	is	compared	to	an
annual	 income	 statement.	 If	 you	 were	 working	 with	 a	 quarterly	 income
statement,	 you	 would	 need	 to	 multiply	 the	 number	 by	 4	 in	 order	 to
ascertain	the	prorated	annual	turnover	rate.
```
**Accounts	receivable	turnover	ratio**

Another	efficiency	ratio	is	the	accounts	receivables	turnover.	This	is	a	nice	key
ratio	that	the	cautious	value	investor	should	keep	an	eye	on	if	the	company	in
mind	sells	a	lot	on	credit.	The	formula	looks	like	this:

```
Accounts	Receivable	Turnover	Ratio	=	Turnover	/	Accounts	Receivables
13,279/3,897	=	3.41
```

Turnover	is	actually	the	revenues	of	the	business	found	on	the	Income	Statement
(line	1)

Accounts	receivable	is	found	on	the	asset	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	2)

In	order	to	make	this	number	more	meaningful,	let’s	convert	it	into	days.	To	do
this	calculation,	simply	take	365	days	(if	using	an	annual	income	statement)	and
divide	by	the	turnover	ratio	(3.41).	When	you	conduct	that	math,	you’ll	get	107
days.	This	means	that	once	Coca-Cola	makes	a	sale,	it	typically	takes	107	days
for	 them	 to	 receive	 payment	 from	 their	 customer.	 As	 you	 might	 be	 thinking,
that’s	a	slow	payment.	Without	much	experience,	any	investor	can	realize	that	a
faster	payment	is	better	for	the	business	because	it	puts	cash	in	the	hands	of	the
company.	In	general,	Coca-Cola	wants	this	ratio	to	be	as	high	as	possible.	A
higher	ratio	means	the	company	gets	their	money	a	lot	faster	from	vendors

Like	most	extremes,	there’s	a	silver	lining.	Since	credit	typically	allows	us	to
increase	sales,	one	must	also	consider	that	if	vendors	are	required	to	make	quick
payments,	they	may	lose	a	portion	of	their	sales.	So	if	I	had	to	give	a	threshold,	I
would	 suggest	 a	 ratio	 between	 5-7	 would	 be	 optimal.	 Again,	 this	 is	 heavily
dependent	on	the	industry	of	the	company.

**Accounts	payable	turnover	ratio**

This	key	ratio	looks	at	how	a	company	handles	its	credit	obligations,	and	it	is
very	relevant	if	the	company	often	buys	on	credit.	Let’s	first	take	a	look	at	the
formula:

```
Accounts	Payable	Turnover	Ratio	=	Cost	of	Revenue	/	Accounts	Payable
5,348	/	2,183	=	2.45
```
Cost	of	Revenue	is	found	on	the	Income	Statement	(line	2)

Accounts	Payable	is	found	on	the	liability	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	1)

Again,	let’s	turn	this	ratio	into	a	metric	that	we	can	understand.	If	we	take	365
days	 (if	 using	 an	 annual	 income	 statement)	 and	 divide	 by	 the	 turnover	 ratio
(2.45),	we	get	149	days.	This	means	that	on	average	it	takes	Coca-Cola	149	days
to	repay	their	suppliers	(i.e.,	the	sugar	supplier).	In	general,	we	like	the	idea	of
having	a	high	accounts	payable	turnover	ratio.	This	would	mean	that	Coca-Cola
has	paid	back	its	suppliers	rather	quickly,	and	as	a	shareholder	we	like	to	see	that
our	investment	has	no	problem	honoring	its	debt	obligations.

On	the	other	hand,	a	company	can	also	be	too	generous.	Say	that	Coca-Cola	has
a	good	position	to	negotiate	when	buying	sugar	and	they	are	able	to	secure	a


very	long	line	of	credit	before	they	have	to	make	the	payment	to	the	supplier.
This	is	in	reality	an	interest-free	loan	to	Coca-Cola.	As	a	shareholder,	we	like
that	 too.	 Long	 interest-free	 loans	 would	 also	 equal	 high	 accounts	 payables,
which	in	turn	would	lead	to	a	low	accounts	payable	turnover.

A	ratio	of	between	two	to	six	is	typically	a	sign	of	an	efficient	company	that	is
satisfying	bargaining	power	and	at	the	same	time	having	no	problem	paying	its
obligations	to	suppliers.

**Solvency	ratios**

**Debt-to-equity	ratio**

This	key	ratio	is	one	of	the	most	quoted	when	risk	is	being	discussed	between
investors.	Let’s	take	a	look	at	the	formula:

```
Debt-to-Equity	Ratio	=	(Long	Term	Debt	+	Notes	Payable)	/	Equity
(3,211	+	498)	/	18,398	=	20.2%
```
Long-Term	Debt	is	found	on	the	liability	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	6)

Notes	Payable	is	found	on	the	liability	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	2)

Equity	is	found	on	the	liability	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	15)

If	this	key	ratio	rings	a	bell,	it’s	because	Warren	Buffett	puts	a	lot	of	emphasis
on	this	metric—you	might	remember	this	ratio	from	Chapter	4,	Principle	1,	Rule
1.

As	we	saw,	there	is	nothing	wrong	with	a	little	debt.	Debt	can	sometimes	make
things	go	a	little	faster,	and	that	is	quite	all	right.	Too	much	debt,	on	the	other
hand,	can	undermine	the	very	existence	of	a	business.	If	you	had	to	choose,	it
would	be	preferable	to	have	as	low	a	debt-to-equity	ratio	as	possible.

When	we	are	talking	about	debt,	we	are	usually	talking	about	 _interest-bearing
debt_ .	This	is	debt	that	we	should	pay	interest	on.	That	is	also	why	this	key	ratio
is	composed	of	long-term	debt	and	notes	payable.	This	is	debt	that	you	typically
have	acquired	from	the	bank.	You	can	think	of	this	as	the	most	expensive	debt	to
obtain.	Why?

Let’s	compare	interest-bearing	debt	to	another	liability	such	as	accounts	payable.
Accounts	payable	are	purchases	that	you	have	made	on	a	line	of	credit,	which
can	basically	be	seen	as	interest-free	loans.	Long-term	debt	and	notes	payable,
on	the	other	hand,	include	interest	expenses	that	you	need	to	pay	on	a	regular
basis.


Looking	at	the	financial	statement	for	Coca-Cola,	you	could	conclude	that	for
every	time	the	shareholders	own	$100	in	equity,	they	also	owe	$20.2	in	debt	that
Coca-Cola	is	paying	interest	on.

In	general,	Warren	Buffett	does	not	like	to	have	a	debt-to-equity	ratio	of	above
0.5.

**Liabilities-to-equity	ratio**

Okay,	 you	 might	 have	 a	 hard	 time	 finding	 this	 ratio	 in	 other	 accounting	 and
investment	books.	The	reason	is	that	it	is	most	often	called	 _debt-to-equity	ratio_.
But,	hey—didn’t	I	just	calculate	that?	Yes,	you	did,	but	there	are	actually	two
different	approaches	when	looking	at	a	company’s	solvency.	Let’s	take	a	look	at
the	formula:

```
Liabilities	to	Equity	Ratio	=	Total	Liabilities	/	Equity
8,688	/	18,398	=	47.2%
```
Total	Liabilities	is	found	on	the	liability	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	10)

Equity	is	found	on	the	liability	column	of	the	Balance	Sheet	(line	15)

If	this	was	an	analysis	of	Coca-Cola’s	solvency,	we	would	conclude	that	every
time	the	shareholder	has	$100	in	equity,	the	company	would	have	to	pay	out
$47.2	 at	 some	 point	 in	 the	 future.	 This	 key	 ratio	 includes	 all	 liabilities.	 That
means	 that	 the	 money	 Coca-Cola	 has	 borrowed	 from	 the	 bank	 and	 is	 paying
interest	on	is	included	just	as	much	as	the	sugar	that	Coca-Cola	has	bought	on
credit	from	a	supplier.

More	conservative	value	investors	like	to	look	at	this	key	ratio	instead	of	the
debt-to-equity	ratio.	They	do	like	to	distinguish	between	interest-bearing	debt,
which	 is	 the	 most	 expensive,	 and	 interest-free	 liabilities	 such	 as	 accounts
payable.	As	a	rule	of	thumb,	the	liabilities-to-equity	ratio	should	be	below	0.8	to
be	considered	low-risk.

## Cash	Flow	Statement	in	Detail

When	 investors	 think	 about	 financial	 statements,	 they	 usually	 think	 of	 the
income	statement	and	the	balance	sheet.	Amateur	investors	often	overlook	the
cash	flow	statement	even	though	it	is	a	source	of	very	valuable	information.	It
connects	the	income	statement	with	the	balance	sheet,	thereby	giving	the	reader
a	synergized	vantage	point	of	the	company’s	financial	situation.	Looking	at	a
corporate	 cash	 flow	 statement	 would	 be	 similar	 to	 being	 able	 to	 look	 at	 an
individual’s	checking	account	each	month.


## Introduction	to	the	cash	flow	statement

Let	 me	 walk	 you	 through	 a	 short	 example.	 You	 are	 looking	 at	 Coca-Cola’s
balance	 sheet	 and	 you	 discover	 that	 the	 cash	 balance	 is	 increasing.	 Are	 you
pleased	about	that?	Who	knows—the	increase	in	cash	may	arise	because	Coca-
Cola	is	making	more	money.	If	that	is	the	case,	you	should	be	pleased.	On	the
other	hand,	the	cash	balance	might	have	increased	because	Coca-Cola	has	taken
out	a	loan	or	issued	more	shares	(which	diluted	your	equity).	This	is	where	the
cash	flow	statement	helps	clarify	the	picture.



As	you	might	have	already	noticed,	the	cash	flow	statement	is	divided	into	three
major	groups.

```
The	first	section	is	the	 cash	flow	from	operating	activities	 (lines	1-6).	The
cash	received	under	this	category	is	the	heart	of	the	company—the	cash
received	 from	 daily	 operations.	 “But	 can’t	 we	 see	 this	 in	 the	 income
statement,”	you	might	say.	Let	me	give	you	this	simple	example	to	think
about:	Coca-Cola	sells	soft	drinks	to	Wal-Mart	for	$1,000.	They	agree	that
Wal-Mart	has	to	pay	the	money	for	the	goods	in	90	days.	While	we	would
record	$1,000	immediately	as	revenue	on	the	income	statement,	we	would
not	register	any	cash	flowing	into	Coca-Cola	for	ninety	days.	So,	as	you
see	in	this	simple	example,	revenue	or	net	income	is	not	the	same	as	cash.
The	next	section	is	the	 cash	flow	from	investments 	(lines	7—11).	Coca-
Cola	has	to	invest	in	and	replace	its	soft	drinks	production	machines—
among	many	other	things.	They	must	continually	invest	and	replace	the
trucks	that	deliver	the	soft	drinks	to	the	customers.	All	companies	must
make	investments	to	keep	their	businesses	running.	This	section	is	where
those	investment	activities	are	captured.
Finally,	we	have	a	section	called	 cash	from	financing	activities 	(lines	12	-
16).	This	section	reveals	many	of	the	secrets	as	to	why	the	cash	balance
has	changed.	Perhaps	Coca-Cola	has	acquired	new	debt;	perhaps	dividends
have	been	paid	to	the	shareholders.	The	serious	value	investor	should	dig
deep	into	this	section	before	any	investment	decisions	are	made.
```
As	you	might	have	noticed,	the	cash	flow	statement	starts	with	the	bottom	line	of
the	income	statement	(net	income),	and	ends	with	the	top	line	of	the	Balance
sheet	(Cash	and	Cash	Equivalents).	As	you	can	see,	the	cash	flow	statement	truly
bridges	the	gap	between	the	income	statement	and	balance	sheet.

##### Cash	flow	from	operating	activities	(lines	1	-	6):

Cash	 generated	 from	 operations	 reflects	 the	 ability	 of	 the	 organization	 to
generate	cash	from	its	core	business	operations.	As	such,	we	want	the	cash	flow
from	operations	to	be	as	high	as	possible.

Our	starting	point	for	the	cash	flow	from	operating	activities	is	the	net	income
(the	bottom	line	on	the	income	statement).	Hey,	didn’t	I	just	say	that	cash	is
something	completely	different	than	net	income?	Yes	I	did,	but	the	net	income	is
only	 our	 starting	 point.	 As	 we	 move	 down	 the	 cash	 flow	 statement,	 the	 net


income	will	be	adjusted	accordingly.

Here’s	an	example.	The	net	income	is	the	money	(not	the	cash),	that	a	company
has	made	during	a	year	or	quarter.	For	simplicity,	let’s	assume	that	to	date	all	net
income	actually	turned	to	cash	for	Coca-Cola	and	the	net	income	is	$1,000	for
the	year.	Then,	just	before	the	financial	statements	are	made	for	the	year,	a	deal
takes	place	with	a	customer	that	results	in	a	$100	net	income	increase.	Should
the	net	income	now	be	$1,100?	Yes,	it	should.	 _But,	_ let’s	say	the	cash	from	the
$100	deal	was	not	to	be	received	until	the	next	fiscal	year.	In	this	situation,	the
cash	from	operating	activities	would	still	be	$1,000	as	there	is	no	additional	cash
inflow	for	the	present	fiscal	year.	In	this	situation,	you	would	see	the	first	line	in
the	cash	flow	statement	listed	as	$1,100,	but	a	subsequent	line	in	the	statement
would	subtract	$100	out	to	arrive	at	a	cash	flow	value	of	$1,000.

In	reality,	Coca-Cola	would	have	a	variety	of	different	transactions	that	would
distort	the	net	income	from	the	actual	cash	flow	from	operations.	Let’s	take	a
closer	look.

**Net	income	(1)**

So	this	is	our	starting	point.	As	you	will	recall,	you	can	find	this	number	at	the
very	bottom	of	the	income	statement.	From	this	point,	we	need	to	adjust	for	all
non-cash	items.	All	of	the	other	lines	in	the	operating	cash	flow	section	are	non-
cash	items	so	there	will	be	plenty	of	adjustments.

**Depreciation	(2)**

Sometimes	this	line	is	also	called	 _depreciation	and	amortization_ 	(amortization	is
the	term	used	to	depreciate	an	intangible	asset).	Other	times,	it	is	simply	grouped
into	a	line	called	 _non-cash	items_ .	As	depreciation	is	often	the	most	significant
non-cash	item,	I	have	chosen	to	use	this	name	for	the	line.

Do	you	remember	depreciation?	Let	me	just	give	you	a	quick	recap.	Assume	that
Coca-Cola	buys	a	car	at	a	price	of	$12,000.	If	the	car	is	going	to	be	depreciated
over	six	years,	it	would	imply	that	the	car	will	lose	a	value	of	$2,000	every	year.
The	process	of	a	tangible	asset	losing	value	is	what	we	call	depreciation.

So	this	is	the	trick:	depreciation	is	a	non-cash	item,	which	means	that	there	is	no
cash	spent	except	the	$12,000	the	very	first	year.	As	such,	you	should	add	back
the	depreciation	for	the	later	years.	Okay,	let’s	stop	for	a	minute.	What	did	that
mean?

Let	 me	 illustrate	 this	 for	 you.	 Below	 is	 a	 shorthand	 income	 statement	 where


Coca-Cola	has	revenue	of	$10,000	and	other	expenses	for	$3,500.	As	we	just
saw,	the	depreciation	is	$2,000	for	each	year.	Let’s	also	assume	that	revenue	and
other	 expenses	 are	 all	 paid	 in	 cash.	 According	 to	 the	 shorthand	 income
statement,	Coca-Cola	should	receive	$4,500	in	cash...

```
Shorthand	Income	Statement
```
```
Revenue 10,000
Other	expenses 3,500
Depreciation 2,000
```
```
Net	income 4,500
```
Now	 for	 the	 shorthand	 cash	 flow	 statement.	 Here,	 we	 add	 the	 $2,000	 of
depreciation	 back	 because	 it	 was	 a	 non-cash	 item.	 We	 therefore	 get	 the
following:

```
Shorthand	Cash	Flow	Statement
```
```
Net	Income 4,500
Depreciation 2,000
```
```
Operating	cash	flow 6,500
```
When	 you	 think	 about	 it,	 it	 makes	 perfect	 sense.	 $10,000	 was	 the	 revenue
received	in	cash	and	$3,500	was	the	expenses	paid	in	cash.	You	should	end	up
with	 $6,500,	 right?	 Yes!	 Remember,	 the	 car	 was	 already	 paid	 for	 years	 ago.
When	 that	 cash	 transaction	 occurred,	 it	 would	 have	 been	 represented	 on	 a
previous	cash	flow	statement.

This	is	why	the	depreciation	is	subtracted	on	the	income	statement,	but	added	on
the	cash	flow	statement.

This	simple	example	is	the	roadmap	to	how	cash	flow	statements	are	made.

**Other	non-cash	items	(3)**

Just	as	depreciation	is	a	non-cash	item,	we	also	find	more	of	these	on	the	income


statement.	Remember	the	line _	net	interest	income	and	expenses_ ?	It	is	in	line	10	if
you	return	to	the	income	statement.	An	example	of	a	non-cash	item	in	this	line
for	a	multinational	company	such	as	Coca-Cola	could	be	the	income	or	expense
from	the	exchange	rate.

It	could	also	be	in	line	11	for	 _extraordinary	income	and	losses_ .	Disposal	of	an
asset	might	either	result	in	a	gain	or	loss	when	compared	to	the	net	book	value
shown;	 for	 example,	 if	 Coca-Cola	 sold	 an	 asset	 for	 $10,000	 which	 had	 an
accounting	value	of	$15,000,	a	loss	of	$5,000	is	incurred.

Does	that	mean	that	Coca-Cola	had	to	pay	$5,000	to	the	seller?	I	hope	not!	The
impact	of	this	transaction	on	cash	flow	is	simply	an	inflow	of	cash	of	$10,000.
Gains	 and	 losses	 are	 primarily	 accounting	 concepts	 and	 therefore	 the	 loss	 of
$5,000	 reported	 on	 the	 income	 statement	 is	 added	 back	 to	 the	 net	 income	 in
order	to	account	for	the	cash	transactions.	The	notion	is	no	different	from	what
you	just	saw	with	depreciation.

So	what	happens	to	the	$10,000	which	was	the	actual	cash	inflow	received	from
selling	the	asset?	Surely	we	must	record	that	in	some	way	to	indicate	that	Coca-
Cola	has	received	$10,000.	That	is	true,	but	the	$10,000	is	an	investing	cash
inflow,	which	we	will	look	at	later,	and	not	a	part	of	the	operating	cash	flow.

At	first,	this	line	might	have	your	head	spinning	for	a	while.	From	an	investor’s
point	of	view,	you	must	not	delve	into	the	complexities	of	accounting	standards.
Just	simply	remember	that	some	line	items	within	the	income	statement	do	not
result	in	an	inflow	or	outflow	of	cash	and	therefore	must	be	added	or	deducted	to
our	starting	point,	which	is	the	net	income.

**Deferred	taxes	(4)**

As	you	may	recall	from	the	balance	sheet,	deferred	taxes	occur	when	there	are
temporary	 differences	 between	 the	 accounting	 value	 and	 tax	 value	 of	 assets.
Previously,	we	showed	this	by	depreciation.

The	thing	about	deferred	taxes	is	that	it	is	 _deferred_ .	That	means	that	it	is	tax	that
should	not	be	paid	in	the	same	fiscal	year	as	when	the	company	reports	a	profit.
Or,	said	another	way:	if	Coca-Cola’s	net	income	is	$100	and	the	tax	rate	is	35%,
the	company	is	not	obliged	to	pay	$35.	Sometimes	it	pays	more,	but	more	often
than	not	it	will	pay	less.	In	either	case,	it	has	an	impact	on	how	much	cash	is
going	in	and	out	of	the	company—and	this	is	why	deferred	taxes	are	included	in
the	cash	flow	statement.

**Changes	in	working	capital	(5)**


I	just	keep	coming	up	with	new	accounting	terms,	don’t	I?	“When	will	it	stop?”
you	 might	 think.	 Well,	 if	 that	 is	 what	 you	 are	 thinking,	 worry	 no	 more:
everything	there	is	to	know	about	working	capital	is	something	you	are	already
familiar	with.

The	way	to	look	at	working	capital	is	to	think	about	current	assets	and	current
liabilities—i.e.,	the	cash	inflow	and	outflow	for	the	next	twelve	months,	found
on	 the	 balance	 sheet.	 Examples	 include	 the	 inventory,	 accounts	 payable,
accounts	 receivable—basically	 all	 that	 is	 needed	 to	 run	 the	 business’s	 daily
operations.	 To	 make	 it	 easier,	 we	 call	 this	 _working	 capital._ Now,	 the	 name
should	make	more	sense.	As	seen	in	the	cash	flow	statement	above,	the	working
capital	is	-$832.	That	means	that	$832	less	is	tied	up	in	the	daily	operations	of
the	business	than	the	previous	year.	That	is	good!	Working	capital	is	expensive,
so	we	want	to	limit	it.

Imagine	that	the	inventory	balance	at	Coca-Cola	at	the	end	of	the	first	year	is
$2,190	and	the	inventory	balance	at	the	end	of	the	second	year	is	$2,486	(which
is	 the	 number	 we	 see	 in	 our	 current	 balance	 sheet).	 In	 this	 case,	 Coca-Cola
would	have	tied	up	296	more	dollars	in	cash	during	year	two	in	raw	materials,
finished	goods	and	so	on.	That	means	that	the	working	capital	has	 _increased_ 	by
$296.

The	accounts	receivable	for	Coca-Cola	at	the	end	of	year	one	are	$4,625.	By	the
end	of	year	two,	this	account	has	decreased	to	$3,897.	That	means	that	Coca-
Cola	 has	 now	 sold	 $728	 dollars	 less	 on	 credit.	 In	 other	 words,	 the	 working
capital	has	now	 _decreased_ 	by	$728.

Hopefully	you	see	where	this	is	going!	We	can	do	the	same	thing	for	each	and
every	 sub	 category	 in	 the	 working	 capital.	 This	 also	 includes	 the	 accounts
payable,	prepaid	expenses	and	accrued	expenses.	All	of	these	are	accounts	that
we	have	seen	in	the	balance	sheet	earlier.

The	only	question	we	have	to	ask	is	whether	or	not	we	have	tied	up	more	cash.	If
we	have	tied	up	more	cash,	we	have	also	increased	the	working	capital,	and	vice
versa.	So,	if	the	cash	flow	statement	introduced	in	this	chapter	was	for	Coca-
Cola	and	you	read	the	working	capital	to	be	-$832,	it	may	look	like	this	if	you
were	looking	behind	the	numbers:

```
Inventory 296
Accounts	receivable -728
```

```
Accounts	payable -511
Prepaid	expenses 65
Accrued	expenses 46
Working	capital -832
```
**Cash	flow	from	operating	activities	(6)**

When	 adding	 up	 all	 the	 previous	 lines	 for	 the	 core	 activities	 of	 Coca-Cola’s
business,	you	get	a	very	important	number.	Think	about	it	like	this:	if	you	were
trying	to	determine	your	friend’s	earning	capacity	each	year,	you	might	want	to
only	look	at	the	money	he	made	from	the	work	he	performed.	That’s	what	cash
flow	from	operating	activities	represents.

Here’s	 an	 example:	 Let’s	 say	 your	 friend	 made	 $60,000	 from	 the	 job	 he
performs	daily.	Also,	let’s	say	your	friend	sold	his	house	and	had	a	one-time
gain	of	$50,000	during	that	same	year.	To	make	things	even	more	interesting,
let’s	 say	 your	 friend	 wanted	 to	 purchase	 a	 new	 car	 and	 took	 out	 a	 loan	 for
$30,000.	Now,	the	amateur	investor	might	say	that	your	friend	made	$140,000	in
cash	for	the	year.	We	know	better	than	that.	Instead,	your	friend’s	cash	flow
statement	would	look	like	this:

Cash	flow	from	operating	activities:	$60,000
Cash	flow	from	investing	activities:	$50,000
Cash	flow	from	financing	activities:	$30,000

As	you	can	see	from	this	example,	the	only	cash	flow	that	represents	a	stable	and
predictable	earnings	capacity	is	the	one	obtained	from	operating	activities.	The
other	two	increases	involve	selling	an	asset	(the	house)	and	taking	on	debt	(the
car	loan).	This	is	extremely	important—you	need	to	look	at	the	cash	flow	from
operating	activities	and	ensure	it’s	the	primary	pump	for	the	company’s	cash
flow.	 When	 you	 look	 at	 the	 five-year	 trends	 on	 the	 company’s	 cash	 flow
statement,	nothing	spells	trouble	faster	than	a	company	that	continually	raises
cash	outside	of	the	company’s	operating	activities.

##### Cash	generated	from	investing	activities	(lines	7	-	11)

In	contrast	to	the	operating	cash	flow,	we	want	the	cash	flow	from	investing
activities	to	be	negative.	Yes,	you	heard	right!	We	want	to	pay	out	cash.	Let’s
look	into	the	explanation	for	that.

As	a	shareholder	of	Coca-Cola,	you	might	like	the	idea	of	having	as	much	cash


in	 the	 company	 as	 possible.	 The	 investing	 activities	 reveal	 the	 transactions
within	capital	expenditure	such	as	a	newly	purchased	asset	or	the	disposal	of
non-current	assets.	So,	on	digging	into	the	investing	cash	flow	for	Coca-Cola,
you	 might	 realize	 that	 the	 increase	 in	 cash	 comes	 from	 selling	 their	 assets.
Generating	cash	from	the	disposal	of	assets	may	look	good	today	when	cash	is
pouring	 in—but	 if	 there	 are	 no	 machines	 available	 for	 producing	 soft	 drinks,
how	will	Coca-Cola	generate	cash	tomorrow?

An	analysis	of	cash	flow	from	investing	activities	reveals	the	growth	strategy
pursued	by	the	corporation.	Any	cash	outlay	from	investing	activities	has	the
long-term	goal	of	increasing	the	company’s	future	cash	flow.	In	following	years,
the	purchase	of	more	assets	should	produce	a	larger	operating	cash	flow,	which
in	turn	will	pay	for	more	investments	at	a	later	date.

In	the	following	section,	you	will	see	that	the	lines	are	labeled	 _net._ 	Net	simply
means	 that	 purchases	 and	 sales	 are	 grouped	 into	 the	 same	 line.	 If	 Coca-Cola
buys	a	new	machine	for	$100	and	sells	the	old	one	for	$60,	the	net	value	cash
flow	is	-$40	($60-$100).	Remember,	the	purchase	of	a	new	asset	makes	this	row
negative.	The	sale	of	an	asset	makes	this	row	positive.

**Property,	plant	and	equipment—net	(7)**

This	 line	 is	 sometimes	 referred	 to	 as	 _Capital	Expenditures,	cap	spending,_ or
simply	 _CAPEX_ .	You	may	remember	this	line	from	the	balance	sheet.	 _Property,
Plant	and	Equipment_ 	is	often	the	most	significant	line	of	the	non-current	assets,
and	it	is	often	no	different	when	it	comes	to	the	investing	cash	flow.

An	example	could	be	Coca-Cola	buying	new	equipment	that	speeds	up	its	soft
drinks	production	process.	It	is	an	investing	activity	because	the	expenditure	is
undertaken	for	the	purpose	of	increasing	Coca-Cola’s	operating	capacity.	The
cash	expense	for	the	acquisition	of	non-current	assets	is	not	accounted	for	within
the	 income	 statement.	 Rather,	 a	 charge	 for	 depreciation	 is	 made	 within	 the
income	statement	and	the	current	value	is	reported	within	the	balance	sheet.	This
is	 all	 conducted	 in	 subcategories	 that	 you	 don’t	 see	 on	 the	 typical	 high-level
balance	sheet.

However,	it	is	the	cash	flow	statement	we	are	looking	at	now.	That	means	that
the	cash	outflow	takes	place	within	the	year	in	which	the	fixed	asset	is	acquired.
The	cash	balance	decreases	by	the	amount	of	the	purchase	and	it	is	deducted
from	the	investing	activities.

Most	often	you	will	find	this	line	to	be	negative,	which	is	very	logical.	Coca-


Cola	will	buy	more	property,	plant,	and	equipment	than	they	will	typically	be
selling.	There	are	rare	occasions	when	you	will	find	this	line	to	be	positive;	this
means	 that	 the	 company	 has	 sold	 more	 of	 its	 assets	 than	 it	 has	 invested.	 In
general,	you	should	be	very	cautious	when	you	see	this.	While	cash	may	be	nice
to	have	today,	companies	may	find	themselves	shorthanded	if	the	funds	aren’t
used	to	purchase	more	valuable	assets	or	service	expensive	debt.

**Intangible	assets—net	(8)**

A	corporation	might	also	acquire	intangible	assets	in	a	given	year	with	the	aim
of	improving	its	market	position;	for	example,	Coca-Cola	might	patent	a	new
soft	drinks	recipe.	That	is	often	a	good	thing.	Big	investments	in	tangible	assets
do	not	always	indicate	a	growing	business.	For	many	companies,	the	growth	in
tangible	and	intangible	assets	goes	hand	in	hand.

As	in	the	above	case,	you	will	most	likely	find	this	line	to	be	negative	too.	That
is	what	you	should	be	looking	for.	Sometimes	a	corporation	will	sell	intangible
assets	if	the	assets	fail	to	increase	profitability	or	if	they	are	no	longer	considered
a	part	of	the	organization’s	core	operating	activities.	Sale	of	intangible	assets
such	as	patents	and	trademarks	would	result	in	an	inflow	of	cash	and	this	would
be	reported	within	the	investing	cash	flow	as	an	increase.

**Businesses—net	(9)**

Very	few	things	in	this	world	are	black	or	white,	and	the	purchase	and	sale	of
businesses	 is	 as	 gray	 as	 it	 gets.	 Large	 companies	 in	 particular	 acquire
competitors	 on	 a	 regular	 basis—simply	 put,	 it’s	 a	 very	 common	 method	 for
growing	a	business.

As	an	outsider,	it	is	hard	to	estimate	whether	or	not	the	acquisition	of	another
business	is	a	good	investment.	Often	this	depends	on	how	the	new	business	will
be	integrated	into	the	group,	and	very	few	outsiders	have	that	knowledge.

In	 general,	 Warren	 Buffett	 believes	 that	 companies	 should	 stick	 to	 their	 core
activities.	In	the	case	of	Coca-Cola,	this	means	that	the	company	should	focus	on
the	beverage	industry	and	not	buy	businesses	in	other	sectors.

I	don’t	mind	finding	this	line	negative	since	this	means	that	more	money	has
been	spent	on	purchasing	new	businesses	rather	than	selling.	But	it	is	a	gray
area,	for	sure.	Remember,	when	Coca-Cola	buys	others	businesses,	the	money
does	not	come	from	thin	air;	it	is	the	owners’	money!	Growth	is	nice,	but	growth
can	 also	 occur	 at	 a	 high	 cost/premium.	 This	 is	 why	 Warren	 Buffett	 is	 very
cautious	when	looking	at	this	line.


**Investments—net	(10)**

Coca-Cola	 might	 find	 it	 interesting	 to	 buy	 shares	 and	 bonds	 in	 various
companies.	It	may	also	be	tempting	to	buy	derivatives	in	different	shapes	and
forms.	But	always	remember	that	it	is	the	shareholders’	money.	Coca-Cola	does
not	own	anything.

As	 a	 shareholder,	 I	 like	 to	 see	 that	 a	 company	 has	 sufficient	 cash.	 It	 is	 also
acceptable	if	some	of	the	excess	cash	is	temporarily	tied	up	in	a	few	investments
—I	like	the	idea	that	it	yields	a	decent	return	while	it	is	still	a	part	of	the	liquidity
basis.	 Where	 managers	 typically	 get	 into	 trouble	 with	 the	 purchase	 of
investments	is	when	they	cross	the	threshold	of	passive	ownership	and	move	into
a	 controlling	 share	 of	 the	 business	 that	 they	 don’t	 understand.	 For	 example,
Coca-Cola’s	management	has	expertise	in	soft	drinks	and	distribution.	If	they
make	 investments	 in	 companies	 that	 are	 conducting	 financial	 services,	 that’s
probably	 outside	 their	 realm	 of	 expertise.	 This	 becomes	 a	 problem	 when	 the
company	would	gain	a	controlling	share	of	the	financial	service	business	and
now	be	the	parent	company—responsible	for	overall	management.	History	has
shown	 countless	 corporate	 victims	 that	 have	 overextended	 their	 level	 of
expertise	and	often	paid	a	high	premium	as	well.	It’s	always	important	to	use
laser	focus	when	finding	a	business.	I’m	not	implying	it	can’t	be	done,	but	I	am
suggesting	it	adds	potential	risk	to	the	owner.

**Cash	flow	from	investing	activities	(11)**

When	you	add	up	all	the	cash	flow	that	Coca-Cola	has	spent	on	investing	in
maintenance	and	future	growth	for	the	company	(lines	7—10),	you	end	up	with
the	cash	flow	from	investing	activities.

##### Cash	generated	from	financing	activities	(lines	12	-	17)

If	you	are	searching	for	skeletons	in	the	closet,	this	is	where	you	should	start
looking.	You	will	often	see	big	inflows	and	outflows	of	cash	in	this	section.	As
you	look	at	the	trends	of	the	cash	flow	statement,	you’ll	definitely	want	to	find
the	financing	activities	displaying	a	negative	cash	flow.	It’s	as	simple	as	that!

If	 Coca-Cola	 decides	 to	 issue	 new	 stocks,	 it	 might	 bring	 more	 cash	 into	 the
company,	but	the	existing	shareholders	will	have	diluted	ownership.	If	Coca-
Cola	decides	to	take	on	more	debt,	it	will	surely	get	more	cash	into	the	company,
but	it	is	you,	as	the	owner	of	the	company,	who	will	pay	the	interest	expenses	in
the	end.	If	Coca-Cola	decides	to	pay	out	dividends	to	the	owners,	the	company
may	have	less	cash,	but	it	is	you	as	the	owner	who	receives	the	cash	payment.


As	you	can	see,	cash	flows	from	financing	activities	are	highly	important	for	you
as	a	shareholder.	Now,	let’s	have	a	closer	look	at	the	individual	lines.

**Issuances	of	stock	(12)**

In	 this	 line	 of	 accounting,	 you	 can	 determine	 if	 a	 company	 has	 issued	 more
common	stock	in	order	to	raise	capital.	This	line	can	sometimes	be	combined
with	the	next	line	(13)	“Purchase	of	Stock	for	Treasury.”	When	that	happens,
you’ll	 simply	 see	 the	 combined	 line	 called	 “Issuance/Payments	 of	 Common
Stock,	 net.”	 Regardless	 of	 the	 naming	 convention,	 the	 line	 is	 very
straightforward.	When	this	is	a	positive	number,	that	means	the	company	has
issued	more	common	stock	to	raise	money.	If	it	was	a	negative	number,	that
would	mean	the	company	bought	back	shares	from	the	open	market.

Now,	let’s	talk	about	the	important	question—how	do	we	know	if	this	is	a	good
thing	 or	 bad	 thing?	 Before	 we	 can	 answer	 that	 question,	 we	 first	 need	 to
understand	 the	 basics	 of	 an	 additional	 stock	 issue.	 For	 simplicity,	 I’ll	 have	 a
similar	discussion	in	the	next	section	(13)	for	stock	buy-backs.

A	stock	issue	should	be	treated	the	same	way	as	a	perpetuity	loan	(or	never-
ending	loan).	Think	of	it	like	this:	if	you	owned	every	share	of	the	business,	why
would	you	be	willing	to	give	up	a	piece	of	that	equity?	For	example,	you	own
100%	equity	of	a	business,	but	you	give	away	15%	equity	to	raise	money;	what
kind	 of	 return	 would	 you	 need	 to	 get	 on	 that	 new	 capital	 to	 make	 the	 deal
worthwhile?

This	is	the	very	difficult	question	to	answer	and	it’s	often	a	company’s	chief
financial	officer	(CFO)	who	tries	to	determine	this	during	future	acquisitions	and
financing.	In	an	effort	to	keep	things	simple,	I’ve	provided	a	chart	that	can	be
used	as	a	rule	of	thumb	for	stock	investors.	The	chart	provides	a	quick	tool	for
investors	to	determine	whether	issuance	of	stock	for	financing	decisions	seems
to	be	in	the	best	interest	of	 **current** 	shareholders.	By	looking	up	a	company’s
current	 P/BV	 ratio	 and	 its	 current	 ROE,	 you	 can	 get	 a	 general	 idea	 of	 the
effective	perpetuity	interest	rate	the	 **original** 	shareholders	are	assuming	for	the
issuance	of	the	new	stock.	It’s	important	to	only	use	this	chart	if	the	company
has	a	low	debt-to-equity	ratio	(preferably	0.50	or	less).


As	you	look	at	the	chart,	the	negative	numbers	are	a	good	thing!	They	actually
represent	a	profit	rate.	On	the	other	hand,	the	shaded	positive	numbers	represent
the	effective	perpetuity	interest	rate	the	original	shareholder	would	assume	for
the	issuance	of	more	stock.

So,	 let’s	 say	 you’re	 the	 CFO	 of	 a	 company	 and	 you	 need	 to	 raise	 a	 million
dollars	for	a	new	building.	After	looking	at	all	your	financing	choices,	you	have
a	few	options:	First,	you	could	get	the	money	from	the	bank	at	a	7.5%	interest
rate	for	ten	years.	Second,	you	could	issue	bonds	at	an	8.5%	interest	rate	for	ten
years.	Third,	you	could	issue	more	shares	of	the	company	to	raise	the	money;
assume	your	company	currently	has	a	P/BV	of	1	and	a	ROE	of	6%.

Easy	enough?	If	you	picked	the	last	choice,	that’s	fairly	sensible.	The	last	choice
will	 likely	 lead	 to	 an	 effective	 interest	 rate	 of	 5.22%	 for	 the	 original
shareholders.	Now,	one	caveat:	the	last	choice	should	be	treated	as	a	perpetuity
loan,	whereas	the	other	choices	would	only	last	for	ten	years.	That	makes	a	big
difference.

So	using	this	chart	isn’t	an	absolute	science;	instead	it’s	a	general	tool	that’s
based	 on	 some	 assumptions.	 For	 example,	 the	 ROE	 is	 assuming	 the	 future
investment	 will	 yield	 at	 the	 same	 rate	 as	 the	 company’s	 past	 performance.	 If
you’re	interested	in	understanding	how	the	chart	was	derived	or	how	some	of	the
assumptions	were	determined,	be	sure	to	read	Part	B	in	the	Annex	to	discover
more.

**Purchases	of	stock	for	treasury	(13)**


When	you	find	this	line	to	be	negative,	it	means	that	the	company	is	buying	back
its	 own	 stocks.	 Once	 repurchased,	 the	 stock	 no	 longer	 has	 voting	 rights	 or
entitlements	to	receiving	dividend	payments.	It	is	said	to	be	held	in	 _treasury_.

Remember	that	the	company	does	not	own	its	equity.	The	equity	belongs	to	the
shareholders,	and	as	such	it	is	just	borrowed	by	the	company	to	generate	profit
for	its	owners.

When	a	company	is	buying	back	shares,	the	existing	shareholders	will	increase
their	 relative	 ownership	 in	 the	 company.	 Let	 me	 give	 you	 a	 simple	 example:
Coca-Cola	has	100	shares	outstanding,	and	management	decides	to	buy	back	1
share.	If	you	were	the	owner	of	the	original	shares,	you	owned	1/100	before	the
share	repurchase,	but	after	the	share	repurchase,	your	ownership	of	the	company
increases	to	1/99.

Now,	it	is	easy	to	think	of	this	solely	as	a	good	thing.	You	would	rather	own
1/99	of	Coca-Cola	than	1/100	right?	The	key	issue	is	that	management	bought
back	 the	 share	 with	 the	 shareholders’	 existing	 money.	 In	 other	 words,	 the
management	 in	 Coca-Cola	 increased	 your	 ownership	 with	 your	 own	 money.
That	 is	 money	 that	 could	 be	 paid	 to	 you	 as	 a	 dividend,	 or	 money	 that	 the
management	could	employ	by	investing	in	a	new	income-producing	asset.

To	evaluate	management’s	decision	as	to	whether	or	not	to	buy	back	shares,	you
should	 therefore	 consider:	 How	 much	 am	 I	 willing	 to	 pay	 to	 increase	 my
ownership	in	the	company?

Below	I	have	provided	you	with	a	simple	chart,	serving	as	a	generic	example	to
demonstrate	the	returns	of	a	company’s	two	options	(they	can	retain	earnings	or
they	can	buy	back	shares	with	earnings).	To	start,	let’s	assume	the	company	has
100,000	outstanding	shares,	$100,000	of	equity,	and	a	net	income	of	$10,000
that	can	be	used	for	investment	purposes.	For	chart	1,	that	$10,000	is	going	to	be
retained	in	the	company	and	reinvested	at	the	corresponding	ROE.	For	chart	2,
that	 $10,000	 is	 going	 to	 repurchase	 shares	 and	 the	 company	 will	 continue	 to
operate	at	the	corresponding	ROE.	Let’s	see	how	things	look.


Comparing	the	charts	above,	you	can	see	that	things	became	advantageous	for
the	original	shareholder	when	the	share	buy-backs	occurred	with	a	book	value
below	 1.0.	 An	 important	 assumption	 that	 must	 be	 considered	 during	 this
generalization	is	that	option	1	assumes	the	retained	earnings	are	reinvested	at	the
company’s	previous	ROE	performance.


The	 general	 conclusion	 is	 simple.	 Since	 the	 company	 is	 using	 the	 owners’
money	to	buy	back	shares,	a	share	repurchase	is	only	more	profitable	for	the
shareholder,	at	a	reasonable	price.	If	you	are	more	interested	in	understanding
how	investors	should	evaluate	stock	repurchases,	please	make	sure	to	read	part	C
in	the	Annex.

**Payment	of	cash	dividends	(14)**

Dividend	 payments	 are	 perhaps	 the	 most	 popular	 method	 for	 distributing	 net
income	back	to	the	investors.	One	reason	that	many	investors	prefer	dividends	to
share	 buy-backs	 is	 very	 simple:	 they	 get	 cash	 in	 their	 hands.	 From
management’s	vantage	point,	they	usually	have	the	opposite	opinion.	Since	a
dividend	 payment	 sends	 the	 money	 away	 forever,	 managers	 of	 the	 business
typically	 prefer	 a	 share	 buy-back.	 Management	 also	 prefers	 a	 share	 buy-back
because	they	don’t	pay	taxes	on	the	disbursement	and	they	retain	capital	in	the
company	to	make	future	acquisitions	or	purchases.	In	the	end,	retained	earnings
give	management	flexibility	to	make	business	moves.

Let’s	 assume	 that	 Coca-Cola	 earns	 a	 net	 income	 of	 $100.	 The	 management
decides	to	pay	out	$40	to	the	shareholders.	If	you	are	a	shareholder	and	own	one
share,	and	there	are	100	shares	outstanding,	you	will	receive	a	$0.40	($40/100)
dividend	payment.

Let	 us	 pause	 briefly	 here	 and	 look	 at	 the	 dividend	 payments	 again.	 We	 can
derive	the	following	from	this	example:	we	have	a	 _dividend	payout	ratio_ 	of	40%
(40/100).	So	what	is	happening	to	the	remaining	$60?	After	all,	the	net	income
belongs	to	the	shareholders	and	should	also	be	distributed	back.	Well,	that	$60
will	 be	 reinvested	 in	 the	 company.	 That	 means	 that	 Coca-Cola	 can	 buy	 even
more	 machines	 and	 equipment	 to	 increase	 the	 net	 income	 next	 year.	 In	 most
cases,	dividend	payments	will	be	distributed	each	quarter.	That	means	in	this
example	you	would	get	$0.10	every	three	months,	and	not	$0.40	at	the	end	of
one	year.

As	an	investor,	it’s	very	important	to	ensure	that	the	company	pays	a	reasonable
dividend;	for	example,	if	the	company	had	an	EPS	of	$3.00,	and	a	dividend	rate
of	 $3.05,	 it’s	 obvious	 the	 company	 will	 have	 a	 hard	 time	 sustaining	 that
payment.	Although	you	might	think	that	scenario	is	highly	unlikely,	you	might
be	surprised	what	you	find	on	the	stock	exchange.	Regardless	of	the	likelihood,
if	a	company’s	payout	ratio	(dividend	rate	/	EPS)	is	higher	than	50%-60%,	the
company	might	be	inhibiting	their	ability	over	the	long	haul	to	pay	owners	and
still	 meet	 the	 demands	 of	 the	 company’s	 competition.	 Like	 most	 things,


dividends	 are	 great	 for	 investors,	 but	 too	 much	 of	 one	 thing	 often	 leads	 to
extreme	results	and	instability.

**Issuances/payment	of	debt—net	(15)**

As	we	have	seen,	there	are	various	methods	for	a	company	to	raise	capital.	The
best	way	is	to	make	enough	profit	so	the	company	doesn’t	need	to	borrow	any
money.	 Another	 method	 is	 to	 issue	 shares,	 but	 the	 downside	 is	 that	 it	 often
dilutes	the	value	to	the	existing	shareholders.	Now,	let	us	take	a	look	at	the	last
option.

One	 tempting	 way	 for	 Coca-Cola	 to	 attract	 capital	 is	 simply	 to	 borrow	 the
money.	So	is	that	a	problem?	While	a	little	debt	shouldn’t	be	a	problem,	it	can
easily	start	to	be.	Compare	this	to	your	personal	finances:	if	you	borrow	money
each	month	to	make	ends	meet,	that	situation	is	bound	to	go	wrong	at	some	point
in	time.

I	would	suggest	that	if	you	see	a	company’s	debt	increasing,	you	immediately
dig	into	the	financial	statements	and	understand	the	root	cause.	I	would	take	a
look	at	the	debt-equity	ratio,	and	if	that’s	now	exceeding	0.5,	you’ll	probably
want	to	understand	how	the	company	got	there	and	what	it’s	doing	to	reduce	its
position.

Another	important	consideration	is	the	interest	coverage	ratio	that	was	discussed
at	the	end	of	chapter	6.

Obviously	 there	 are	 instances	 where	 a	 company	 gets	 great	 expansion
opportunities.	 But	 more	 often	 than	 not,	 a	 steep	 increase	 in	 debt	 should	 raise
caution	flags.	This	is	not	the	cash	inflow	you	want	to	see.

In	short,	if	this	line	is	negative,	that	means	the	company	is	paying	off	its	debts.	If
the	number	is	positive,	it	means	the	company	has	taken	on	new	debt	(or	issued
bonds).	This	is	important:	if	you	notice	that	a	company’s	operating	cash	flow	is
negative	(line	6)	and	this	issuance/payment	of	debt	(line	15)	is	positive,	you’re
looking	 at	 a	 company	 that’s	 in	 serious	 trouble.	 This	 means	 the	 company’s
product	 isn’t	 making	 a	 profit	 and	 management	 is	 borrowing	 money	 to	 stay
afloat.	Stay	far	away	from	companies	that	demonstrate	this	situation.

**Cash	flow	from	financing	activities	(16)**

Like	the	previous	summary	rows,	line	16	simply	adds	all	the	financing	activities
together	so	you	can	see	the	big	picture.

##### Arriving	at	the	net	change	in	cash


Now	that	you	understand	how	cash	flows	through	a	business.	Let’s	take	another
look	at	the	cash	flow	statement	and	see	if	it	looks	different.



To	 calculate	 the	 cash	 flow	 from	 operating	 activities,	 we	 started	 with	 the	 net
income	(1).	This	was	our	starting	point	because	it	tells	us	how	much	income
Coca-Cola	has	made	during	the	year.	We	also	saw	that	this	was	just	an	account
measure,	and	not	a	cash	measure.	For	this	reason,	we	made	adjustments	for	the
non-cash	 items	 (2-5).	 After	 the	 adjustments,	 we	 find	 the	 cash	 flow	 from
operating	activities	(6),	which	is	the	cash	Coca-Cola	has	made	from	its	business
activities.

To	find	the	cash	flow	from	investing	activities,	we	look	at	the	money	that	was
used	 for	 sustainment	 or	 growth	 in	 Coca-Cola.	 We	 had	 cash	 transactions	 for
investments	into	tangible	assets	(7),	as	well	as	in	intangible	assets	(8).	Also,	we
included	the	investment	transactions	that	could	be	either	additions	or	new	areas
of	daily	business	(9-10).	Summarizing	these,	we	find	how	much	cash	is	required
to	maintain	and	grow	Coca-Cola	(11)

For	the	cash	flow	from	financing	activities,	we	first	looked	at	the	cash	inflows
and	 outflows	 from	 the	 issuance	 of	 stock	 (12),	 as	 well	 as	 the	 opposite	 effect,
which	was	the	purchase	of	stock	into	the	treasury	(13).	Next,	we	looked	at	the
cash	dividend	payments	which	were	made	to	the	shareholders	(14).	Finally,	we
looked	at	whether	the	company	had	obtained	debt,	or	paid	back	debt	to	their
creditors	 (15).	 Summarizing	 these	 lines,	 we	 end	 up	 with	 all	 the	 cash	 flows
related	to	the	financing	activities	(16).

By	adding	up	the	cash	from	operations,	investing,	and	financing	cash	flows,	the
difference	 was	 $415	 in	 positive	 cash	 flow	 (17).	 These	 are	 all	 the	 cash
transactions	that	took	place	for	Coca-Cola	during	the	year.	Line	17	is	then	added
to	the	cash	balance	from	the	start	of	the	year	(18),	and	we	end	up	with	the	cash
balance	for	the	end	of	the	year	(19).	If	you	compare	line	19	from	the	cash	flow
statement	with	line	1	of	the	balance	sheet	( _cash	_ and	 _cash	equivalents)_ ,	you’ll	see
that	both	numbers	are	exactly	the	same	-$1847.	As	you	can	see,	the	cash	flow
statement	truly	bridges	the	gap	between	the	income	statement’s	bottom	line	and
the	balance	sheet’s	top	line.


##### Key	ratio	analysis	for	the	cash	flow	statement

So	far	we	have	looked	at	key	ratio	analysis	for	both	the	income	statement	and
balance	sheet.	Now	it	is	time	to	dig	into	key	figures	and	ratios	for	the	cash	flow
statement.

**Free	cash	flow:**

This	is	an	extremely	important	number!	You	will	often	see	this	referred	to	as
_FCF.	Free	Cash	Flow_ 	is	actually	not	so	much	a	ratio,	but	it	is	a	very	important
calculation	for	carrying	out	further	analysis.	Many	value	investors	believe	this
figure	 holds	 the	 key	 to	 determining	 the	 intrinsic	 value	 of	 a	 business.	 Let	 me
show	you	the	formula	first:

```
Free	Cash	Flow	=	Operating	cash	flow	+	Property,	Plant,	and	Equipment,	net
3,098	+	(-1,349)	=	1,749
```
Operating	cash	flow	is	found	on	line	6	of	the	cash	flow	statement

Property,	Plant,	and	Equipment	net	is	found	on	line	7	of	the	cash	flow	statement

We	previously	saw	in	our	example	with	Coca-Cola	that	the	operating	cash	flow
was	the	cash	outflow	generated	from	running	the	business.	In	general,	this	is	the
cash	received	for	all	the	soft	drinks	sales.	As	we	look	at	the	net	cash	effect	of
property,	plant	and	equipment,	which	is	a	part	of	the	investing	cash	flows,	we
can	 conclude	 this	 outflow	 of	 cash	 was	 spent	 to	 maintain	 and	 develop	 the
business	 (like	 buying	 new	 machines	 and	 equipment).	 Property,	 Plant	 and
Equipment	 is	 sometimes	 referred	 to	 as	 capital	 expenditures,	 cap	 spending,	 or
simply	CAPEX.	Although	these	terms	are	used	interchangeably	by	many,	there
are	some	differences,	which	are	highlighted	in	advanced	financial	texts.	If	you’re
truly	interested	in	understanding	the	detailed	differences	between	true	CAPEX
and	 the	 abbreviated	 calculation	 we	 provide	 here,	 you	 can	 find	 numerous
resources	on	the	Web	that	provide	various	methods	and	opinions.	For	simplicity
in	calculating	the	FCF	figure,	we	simply	recommend	using	the	Property,	Plant,
and	Equipment	figure.	If	you	find	the	CAPEX	calculation	has	more	utility,	you
can	 simply	 substitute	 that	 number	 for	 the	 Property,	 Plant,	 and	 Equipment
variable	in	the	FCF	calculation	listed	above.

As	 you	 learned	 in	 chapter	 4,	 the	 free	 cash	 flow	 calculation	 was	 the	 main
ingredient	for	the	discount	cash	flow	model.	We	don’t	include	the	financing	cash
flow	in	this	equation	because	borrowed	cash	flows	are	not	funds	the	business	has
actually	earned.	When	using	the	free	cash	flow	to	determine	the	intrinsic	value


of	a	company,	I	strongly	recommend	you	look	at	the	average	FCF	over	a	number
of	years.	You	will	find	that	the	FCF	changes	quite	often	through	the	years,	so
using	a	high	or	low	number	can	drastically	impact	the	value	of	a	business.	At	a
minimum,	I	would	look	at	the	five-year	average	to	try	and	determine	the	FCF	for
the	intrinsic	value	calculation.

In	the	end,	the	free	cash	flow	can	be	paid	out	to	the	shareholders	as	dividends,	it
can	be	returned	in	the	form	of	share	buy-backs,	and	it	can	be	used	to	pay	off	the
company’s	debt.	Basically,	it	is	cash	that	is	flowing	back	to	the	shareholders	in
one	way	or	the	other.	Cash	is	indeed	king,	and	you	will	seldom	be	sorry	about
investing	in	a	company	with	a	high	and	stable	free	cash	flow.


**Free-cash-flow-to-revenue	ratio:**

This	is	often	called	 _Free-Cash-Flow-to-Sales	Ratio_ .	As	you	will	recall,	revenue
and	sales	are	the	same,	so	let	us	be	consistent	and	keep	using	revenue.	Let’s	take


a	look	at	the	formula:

```
Free-cash-flow-to-revenue	ratio	=	{Operating	Cash	Flow	+	Property,	Plant,	and
Equipment,	net}	/	Revenue
{3,098	+	(-1,349)}	/	13,279	=	13.2%
```
What	 does	 the	 13.2%	 mean?	 If	 this	 calculation	 was	 for	 Coca-Cola,	 it	 would
mean	 that	 every	 time	 Coca-Cola	 sells	 soft	 drinks	 for	 $100,	 $13.2	 will	 be
available	as	cash	for	the	shareholders.	This	is	a	very	neat	key	ratio	to	look	at.
Not	only	does	it	show	how	much	income	is	generated—after	all,	income	could
arise	 from	 a	 sale	 on	 credit	 and	 Coca-Cola	 might	 not	 see	 this	 money	 if	 the
customer	defaults—but	this	key	ratio	takes	it	one	step	further	and	measures	how
much	cash	will	go	directly	to	the	owners.

This	calculation	would	show	that	as	much	as	$13.2	from	$100	of	sales	could	be
paid	directly	to	the	shareholders	as	a	dividend.	A	100%	payout	of	the	free	cash
flow	 will	 likely	 never	 happen	 because	 it	 often	 prevents	 the	 company	 from
investing	 in	 future	 acquisitions	 or	 other	 growth	 opportunities	 later	 on.	 As	 a
result,	the	company	will	likely	pay	a	portion	of	that	free	cash	flow	as	a	dividend,
and	the	remainder	will	remain	in	the	company	accounts.

In	general,	you	should	be	looking	for	companies	that	have	a	consistent	free-cash-
flow-to-revenue	ratio	of	at	least	5%.

**Investing-cash-flow-to-operating-cash-flow	ratio:**

Another	important	ratio	in	the	cash	flow	statement	is	found	by	comparing	the
investing	 cash	 flow	 with	 the	 operating	 cash	 flow.	 Let’s	 take	 a	 look	 at	 the
formula:

```
Investing-cash-flow-to-operating-cash-flow	ratio	=
Investing	Cash	Flow	/	Operating	Cash	Flow
1,653	/	3,098	=	53.3%
```
What	 this	 means	 is	 every	 time	 Coca-Cola	 makes	 $100	 in	 cash	 from	 its
operations,	 $53.3	 in	 cash	 are	 spent	 on	 maintaining	 and	 investing	 in	 the
company’s	growth.	It	may	be	tempting	to	conclude	that	this	ratio	should	be	as
low	as	possible—or	in	other	words,	as	much	cash	as	possible	should	be	returned
to	the	shareholders.	But	keep	in	mind	that	investing	cash	flow	is	money	that	is
used	 to	 keep	 the	 business	 running	 properly.	 If	 no	 money	 is	 reinvested	 in	 the
company,	it	will	be	very	hard	to	make	income	in	the	future.	Think	of	it	like	this:
do	you	like	spending	the	night	in	a	rundown	hotel?	Of	course	not—but	let	that


hotel	serve	as	an	example	of	what	it’s	like	to	deal	with	a	business	that	doesn’t
reinvest	their	operational	cash	flow	back	into	the	business.	Companies	that	fail
to	reinvest	in	their	business	often	have	short-term	life	cycles.

How	Warren	Buffett	approaches	this	key	ratio	is	by	looking	at	the	development
of	the	ratio,	and	at	which	level	it	is;	for	example,	say	that	over	a	time	period	of
ten	years	I	find	that	Coca-Cola	has	a	stable	investing	cash	flow	to	operating	cash
flow	of	around	50%.	In	this	case,	I	would	find	it	much	more	appealing	than
Pepsi,	which	had	a	similar	ratio	of	60%.	The	reason	is	simple:	if	all	the	cash	that
the	company	makes	is	just	tied	up	in	new	equipment,	then	I	would	ultimately	not
get	cash	out	as	an	investor.

In	 the	 short	 term,	 it	 should	 not	 be	 a	 problem	 with	 high	 investment	 ratios—
indeed,	 some	 years	 it	 might	 be	 over	 100%	 if	 the	 investment	 possibilities	 are
great.	The	silver	lining	really	depends	on	whether	there	are	cash	investments	for
growing	the	business	or	cash	outlays	for	maintaining	the	existing	business.

Just	remember	that,	in	the	long	run,	Warren	Buffett	understands	the	importance
of	reinvesting	capital	into	the	business,	but	at	the	same	time	he	firmly	believes
cash	should	ultimately	be	returned	to	the	shareholders	in	some	profitable	form!

# Appendix

##### Part	A:	The	Intrinsic	Value	Calculator	and	its	limitations

In	 an	 effort	 to	 provide	 more	 details	 about	 the	 creation	 of	 the	 BuffettsBooks
Intrinsic	Value	Calculator,	this	next	section	is	for	those	who	want	to	understand
the	mechanics	behind	the	calculation.	I	would	argue	that	this	level	of	detail	will
greatly	increase	your	understanding,	but	is	not	a	necessity	for	using	the	model.

##### How	was	the	BuffettsBooks.com	Intrinsic	Value	Calculator

##### derived?

For	 anyone	 who	 has	 read	 Warren	 Buffett	 and	 Benjamin	 Graham’s	 writing
extensively,	you’ll	know	they	often	talk	about	bonds.	In	fact,	Buffett	routinely
mentions	that	bonds	and	stocks	are	valued	in	a	similar	manner.	During	the	1997
Berkshire	 Hathaway	 shareholders’	 meeting,	 Buffett	 was	 asked	 the	 following
question:

_“What	do	you	believe	to	be	the	most	important	tools	in	determining	intrinsic
value?	What	rules	or	standards	do	you	apply	when	using	these	tools?”_

Buffett:	“ _If	we	could	see,	in	looking	at	any	business,	what	its	future	cash	flows
would	be	for	the	next	100	years	and	discount	that	back	at	an	appropriate	interest
rate,	that	would	give	us	a	number	for	intrinsic	value.	It	would	be	like	looking	at
a	bond	that	had	a	bunch	of	coupons	on	it	that	were	due	in	a	hundred	years...
Businesses	have	coupons,	too;	the	only	problem	is	that	they’re	not	printed	on	the
instrument	and	it’s	up	to	the	investor	to	try	to	estimate	what	those	coupons	are
going	to	be	over	time.	In	high-tech	businesses	or	something	like	that,	we	don’t
have	the	faintest	idea	what	the	coupons	are	going	to	be.	In	the	businesses	where
we	think	we	can	understand	them	reasonably	well,	we	are	trying	to	print	the
coupons	out.	If	you	attempt	to	assess	intrinsic	value,	it	all	relates	to	cash	flow.
The	only	reason	to	put	cash	into	any	kind	of	investment	now	is	that	you	expect	to
take	cash	out—not	by	selling	it	to	somebody	else;	that’s	just	a	game	of	who	beats_


_who—but	by	the	asset	itself...”_

In	 a	 _Fortune_ article	 in	 1977,	 Buffett	 makes	 the	 following	 comments
about	the	bond	and	stock	comparison:

_“The	main	reason,	I	believe,	is	that	stocks,	in	economic	substance,	are	really
very	 similar	 to	 bonds.	 I	 know	 that	 this	 belief	 will	 seem	 eccentric	 to	 many
investors.	For	the	moment,	let’s	think	of	those	companies	not	as	listed	stocks...
Let’s	also	assume	that	the	owners	of	those	enterprises	had	acquired	them	at
book	value...	And	because	the	return	has	been	so	consistent,	it	seems	reasonable
to	think	of	it	as	an	‘equity	coupon.’”_

Although	I’ve	only	provided	a	few	quotes	demonstrating	Buffett’s	opinion	that
stocks	 and	 bonds	 are	 valued	 in	 a	 similar	 manner,	 digging	 deeper	 will	 only
solidify	this	position.	Considering	this	fact,	let’s	take	a	closer	look	at	how	the
market	price	of	a	bond	is	determined.

The	value	of	a	high-quality	bond	is	determined	by	the	following	variables:

M	=	The	par	value	or	value	at	maturity
C	=	The	coupon	payment
i	=	Current	interest	rates	or	required	yield
n	=	The	term	or	number	of	payments	that	will	be	received

When	we	apply	these	variables	to	a	discount	cash	flow	model,	we	arrive	at	the
following	equation	for	a	bond’s	market	price:

When	we	look	at	this	big	equation,	we	can	see	that	a	simple	substitution	for	the
variables	mentioned	above	will	provide	the	answer	for	the	value	of	a	bond.	If
you	go	to	Course	2,	Unit	2,	Lesson	4	on	the	BuffettsBooks.com	website,	you’ll
find	a	calculator	that	uses	this	formula.	Although	the	formula	is	not	stated	on	the
page,	the	mechanics	behind	the	code	are	this	equation.

Now	here’s	the	leap:	as	we	look	at	the	comparison	between	bonds	and	stocks,
we	find	very	similar	aspects.	Instead	of	coupons,	we	have	dividends.	Instead	of
par	value,	we	have	equity—or	book	value.

Understanding	how	coupons	and	dividends	are	similar	is	self-explanatory.	But


understanding	 how	 par	 value	 and	 book	 value	 are	 similar	 is	 more	 difficult	 to
comprehend.	Let	me	provide	an	eccentric	example	to	illustrate	my	point.

Imagine	for	a	second	that	you	need	to	value	a	bond	that	has	a	growing	par	value.
Let’s	say	the	bond	is	issued	for	$1,000,	but	when	it	matures	ten	years	later,	the
par/face	value	is	worth	$2,000.	Let’s	also	say	that	the	bond	pays	no	coupon.
How	would	you	value	such	a	security	if	current	interest	rates	where	5%?

The	only	way	we	can	answer	this	question	is	by	calculating	the	asset’s	future
cash	flows	and	discounting	these	back	to	today’s	value	at	the	current	interest
rate.	 Since	 the	 bond	 pays	 no	 coupons,	 the	 only	 cash	 flow	 is	 the	 difference
between	the	two	par	values.	Using	the	formula	provided	above,	substitute	the
following	variables	and	solve	the	problem:

M	=	$2,000
C	=	0
i	=	.05
n	=	10

When	this	substitution	is	completed,	the	bond	price	equals	$1227.8.	This	means
that	our	couponless	bond	with	a	variable	face	value	will	provide	a	5%	return	if	it
can	 be	 purchased	 for	 $1227.8	 on	 the	 current	 market.	 Now,	 you	 might	 be
wondering	 how	 this	 corresponds	 to	 stocks?	 Easy.	 Let’s	 consider	 a	 similar
question	to	exemplify:

Imagine	now	that	you	have	to	value	a	stock	that	has	a	growing	book	value.	Let’s
say	the	stock’s	current	book	value	is	$1,000	but	you	expect	the	book	value	to	be
$2,000	ten	years	from	now.	Also,	you	expect	the	earnings	of	the	business	to
progress	in	lockstep	with	the	book	value	growth	of	the	business.	The	company
pays	no	dividend,	but	you	would	like	to	receive	a	5%	return	on	the	potential
investment.	How	much	should	the	stock	price	be	in	order	to	get	an	expected
return	of	5%?

Let’s	do	a	little	substitution	for	our	new	problem:

M	=	FBV	=	Future	book	value	=	$2,000
C	=	D	=	Dividend	=	0
i	=	Expected	return	or	discount	rate	=	.05
n	=	Number	of	years	=	10

When	we	solve	this	problem,	we	get	the	exact	same	answer:	$1227.8.	As	you
can	 see,	 we’ve	 simply	 modified	 the	 calculation	 for	 a	 bond’s	 market	 price,	 to


work	for	stocks.	In	the	example	above,	we	valued	a	business	with	no	dividend.	If
a	dividend	was	provided,	the	calculation	would	still	be	valid.	It’s	very	important
to	 remember	 that	 this	 calculation	 is	 only	 valid	 for	 stocks	 if	 the	 EPS
proportionally	grows	with	the	book	value	during	this	period.

As	 you	 look	 at	 the	 previous	 example,	 you	 might	 be	 wondering	 how	 we
determined	the	future	book	value	figure.	In	order	to	answer	that	question,	we
have	 to	 start	 by	 finding	 stable	 companies	 that	 have	 predictable	 results.	 This
allows	us	to	place	a	trend	line	on	past	performance	and	use	it	to	estimate	future
results.	If	the	company	has	historically	grown	its	book	value	at	7%	a	year,	then
we	can	use	that	figure	to	estimate	the	future	book	value	figure.

Remember,	 current	 earnings	 and	 short-term	 earnings	 forecasts	 must	 be
consistent	with	past	earnings	performance.	If	they	are	not,	you	can’t	expect	the
book	value	to	grow	like	it	did	in	the	past.	Your	calculations	will	be	inaccurate
and	 misleading.	 If	 current	 and	 forecasted	 earnings	 are	 consistent	 with	 past
earnings,	 they	 should	 provide	 a	 reasonable	 expectation	 of	 future	 book	 value
growth;	for	example,	if	the	company’s	current	book	value	is	$10	a	share,	and	we
expect	the	book	value	growth	rate	to	be	7%	based	on	historical	trends,	then	we
would	use	the	simple	time-value-of-money	formula	to	estimate	the	future	book
value	ten	years	from	now:

FBV	=	Future	book	value	=	?

PBV	=	Present	book	value	=	$10

g	=	Expected	growth	rate	of	book	value	=	.07	or	7%

n	=	Number	of	years	into	the	future	=	10

FBV	=	PBV	(1+	g)n

FBV	=	$10	(1.07)^10

FBV	=	$19.67

In	an	effort	to	simplify	our	bond	market	price	formula	for	stocks,	we’ll	rename
our	variables	as	follows:

```
Annual	coupon	=	The	average	annual	dividend	expected	over	the	next	n	years
Therefore	C	=	D
Par	value	=	The	expected	future	book	value
Therefore	M	=	FBV	=	PBV	(1+	g)n
```

Now	 that	 we	 have	 adjusted	 the	 variables,	 let’s	 substitute	 them	 into	 the	 bond
equation	to	arrive	at	our	intrinsic	value	formula.

Where:

D	=	The	expected	average	annual	dividend	for	the	next	n	years	(in	$)

PBV	=	The	present	book	value	(in	$)

g	=	The	expected	growth	rate	of	book	value	(use	.05	if	5%)

n	=	Number	of	years	into	the	future	you	estimate	cash	flows

i	=	Discount	rate,	or	minimal	acceptable	return	for	investment	(use	.05	if	5%)

Intrinsic	value	=	The	market	price	you	should	pay	in	order	to	potentially	receive
a	return	of	“i”	over	the	next	“n”	years.

##### Accounting	for	a	steady	and	growing	dividend	payment

The	formula	above	is	the	one	used	on	BuffettsBooks.com	for	the	Intrinsic	Value
Calculator.	Some	may	argue	that	the	calculation	accounts	for	a	growing	book
value	but	fails	to	account	for	a	growing	dividend	payment.	The	reason	I	have
neglected	this	computation	is	to	provide	a	built-in	margin	of	safety	for	cash	flow
expectations.	If	this	is	something	you	disagree	with	and	would	like	to	include	in
your	 assessment	 for	 value,	 then	 this	 section	 will	 provide	 details	 on	 how	 to
perform	the	math.	I	would	only	recommend	this	method	for	picks	that	display
extreme	stability	in	all	aspects	of	the	company’s	financial	data.

In	 order	 to	 account	 for	 a	 dividend	 growth	 rate,	 one	 will	 need	 to	 start	 with
historical	 data	 in	 order	 to	 establish	 a	 trend	 line.	 Let’s	 look	 at	 Johnson	 and
Johnson	(JNJ),	for	example.


Above	is	a	screen	capture	from	the	Johnson	and	Johnson	website.	As	you	can
see,	this	graph	represents	a	very	stable	and	steady	dividend	history.	Finding	the
dividend	history	of	a	company	is	generally	an	easy	task.	I	usually	find	this	data
on	 the	 investor	 relations	 section	 of	 the	 company’s	 website.	 A	 simple	 Google
search	of	“dividend	history	for	JNJ”	provided	a	quick	and	easy	link	to	the	above
data.

When	historical	growth	looks	like	this,	implementation	of	this	valuation	method
proves	more	accurate.	In	a	simple	method	of	implementation,	investors	can	fit	a
linear	trend	line	to	the	data	then	estimate	the	average	dividend	for	the	future	term
(usually	ten	years).	In	order	to	do	this,	use	the	following	slope	equation:

This	slope	will	show	the	dividend	growth	in	dollars	($)/year

Instead	 of	 providing	 fixed	 guidance	 that	 prescribes	 measurements	 over	 a	 set
number	of	years,	I	strongly	encourage	investors	to	pick	data	that	represents	a
conservative	 and	 symbolic	 representation	 of	 realistic	 dividend	 growth.	 With
Johnson	 and	 Johnson,	 for	 example,	 let’s	 analyze	 the	 data	 from	 2004	 through

2013.	Below	are	the	inputs	to	our	slope	calculation:


This	 means	 that	 on	 a	 linear	 average	 rate,	 JNJ	 has	 increased	 its	 dividend	 by
$0.184	 for	 each	 year.	 Knowing	 this	 rate,	 we	 can	 now	 estimate	 the	 future
dividend	JNJ	will	pay	over	the	next	ten	years.	Since	the	problem	uses	a	linear
growth	rate,	if	we	determine	the	dividend	five	years	from	now,	we	can	use	this
figure	as	the	average	for	the	ten-year	cash	flow	period.	In	order	to	calculate	this
figure,	use	the	following	equation:

After	solving	this	problem,	you	can	see	we	have	a	higher	annual	dividend	than
what	the	company	is	currently	paying.	If	we	use	this	dividend	in	the	Intrinsic
Value	 Calculator	 instead	 of	 the	 current	 dividend,	 we	 may	 predict	 a	 more
accurate	(and	optimistic)	result.

**Ensure	the	dividend	has	a	history**

One	 factor	 you	 should	 be	 careful	 about	 when	 using	 the	 Intrinsic	 Value
Calculator	 is	 ensuring	 that	 the	 timeframe	 you	 are	 assessing	 for	 past	 growth
accounts	for	a	dividend	and	book	value	growth;	for	example,	let’s	assume	the
book	value	was	growing	at	10%	a	year	on	average	and	now	the	company	has	just
decided	to	start	paying	a	dividend.

An	individual	making	a	quick	intrinsic	value	calculation	may	assume	that	the
dividend	 has	 been	 paid	 over	 an	 extended	 period	 of	 time.	 This	 is	 not
representative,	as	earlier	dividend	payments	would	have	limited	the	past	book
value	growth	accordingly.	This	is	going	to	drastically	misrepresent	the	cash	flow
of	the	business,	making	the	investment	biased	toward	a	more	positive	valuation

In	 order	 to	 avoid	 this	 dangerous	 assessment,	 simply	 ensure	 that	 a	 dividend
history	has	been	paid	for	the	same	term	that	you’re	assessing	book	value	growth


for.

##### Accounting	for	growth	in	treasury	stock

At	the	end	of	2011,	Carol	Loomis	wrote	an	article	for	 _Fortune_ 	titled	 _Buffett	Goes
Big	in	Big	Blue.	_ The	article	was	referencing	Berkshire	Hathaway’s	10.7-billion-
dollar	 stake	 in	 IBM.	 Over	 the	 course	 of	 the	 year,	 Buffett	 had	 managed	 to
purchase	over	64	million	shares	at	about	$167	per	share.

As	 you	 take	 a	 closer	 look	 at	 the	 financial	 information	 on	 IBM,	 you’ll	 notice
some	 very	 peculiar	 things;	 for	 example,	 the	 company’s	 EPS	 at	 the	 time	 of
Buffett’s	purchase	was	around	$13.29.	Based	on	his	purchase	price,	the	P/E	ratio
was	approximately	12.57.	Not	bad,	but	also	not	particularly	exciting.	If	you	look
at	the	dividend	yield,	it	was	1.7%.	Again,	nothing	too	exciting.	What	about	the
historical	equity	growth?

```
Year
```

### Book	Value

2011


### $17.31

2010


### $18.77

2009


### $17.34

_What_ ?	In	fact,	if	you	look	at	IBM’s	book	value	growth	from	2003-2011,	it	went
from	$16.44	to	$17.31.

So	you	might	be	asking	yourself:	 _Why	on	earth	would	Warren	Buffett	buy	a	10-
billion-dollar	stake	in	this	company?_ 	The	dividend	is	marginal	at	best	and	the
book	value	has	barely	moved.	Since	we	know	from	the	intrinsic	calculator	that	a
solid	dividend	and	growth	in	book	value	is	what	makes	an	investment	profitable,
what	is	going	on?

In	order	to	understand	this	mirage,	let’s	take	a	closer	look	at	an	accounting	term
called	 _treasury	stock_ ,	which	I	briefly	introduced	in	the	balance	sheet	as	well	as
in	the	cash	flow	statement.

Treasury	 stock	 is	 the	 name	 for	 the	 shares	 that	 the	 company	 owns	 itself;	 for
example,	let’s	say	IBM	has	a	total	of	1,000	shares	outstanding.	In	an	effort	to
reduce	the	number	of	shares	outstanding,	IBM	has	the	option	to	buy	its	own
shares	on	the	open	market.	To	demonstrate,	let’s	say	the	company	decides	to	buy
back	100	shares	from	the	1,000	shares	on	the	open	market.	In	order	to	take	those
shares	off	the	market,	IBM	needs	to	spend	the	company’s	cash	on	hand	in	order
to	buy	the	shares	from	other	investors.

If	the	current	market	price	for	IBM	shares	is	$155	per	share,	then	IBM	would
reduce	their	cash	account	by	$15,500	in	order	to	buy	back	100	shares.	Once	the
shares	 are	 purchased,	 the	 company’s	 equity	 is	 reduced	 by	 $15,500,	 and	 the
number	of	shares	outstanding	decreases	to	a	total	of	900.	Now,	this	is	where
treasury	 stock	 can	 get	 a	 little	 tricky.	 Once	 the	 shares	 are	 repurchased,	 the
company	has	the	option	to	retire	the	shares	completely,	or	to	keep	them	in	a
treasury	account	and	potentially	re-enter	the	market.	If	the	first	option	is	selected
by	the	company,	the	shares	are	retired	and	never	issued	again.	If	the	shares	are
held	in	the	treasury	account,	they	will	decrease	the	shares	outstanding,	have	no
voting	rights,	and	no	dividends	will	be	paid	on	those	shares.

So	 why	 might	 a	 company	 want	 to	 buy	 its	 own	 shares	 and	 place	 them	 in	 a
treasury	account?	Here	are	a	few	likely	scenarios:

```
Current	owners	gain	more	control	of	the	company.	By	minimizing	the
available	shares	on	the	open	market,	there	are	fewer	shares	for	new
```

```
available	shares	on	the	open	market,	there	are	fewer	shares	for	new
investors	to	acquire,	therefore	limiting	their	potential	stake	of	equity	in
the	company.	This	tactic	might	be	used	by	controlling	shareholders	in
order	to	fend	off	potential	newcomers.
If	the	company	believes	they	are	undervalued,	they	can	take	advantage	of
their	retained	earnings	to	increase	the	equity	of	each	shareholder.	No
one	understands	their	strategic	position	better	than	themselves.
This	way,	the	company	preserves	liquid	capital	by	transferring	it	into
equity.	This	protects	the	capital	from	inflation	and	automatically
reinvests	the	money	at	the	company’s	current	ROE	(worst-case
scenario).
```
So,	 how	 should	 you	 value	 a	 company	 that’s	 heavily	 involved	 in	 share	 buy-
backs?	 Using	 the	 Intrinsic	 Value	 Calculator	 on	 BuffettsBooks.com	 is	 likely
going	to	have	skewed	results	because	the	cash	flow	is	not	being	reflected	in	the
company’s	book	value.	In	this	case,	I	would	simply	use	the	DCF	model,	which
was	introduced	in	Chapter	4,	Principle	4,	Rule	5.	Keep	in	mind,	though,	that
buy-back	programs	as	heavy	as	IBM’s	are	very	rare.

##### Using	the	calculator	for	high-growth	companies

_“It	gets	very	dangerous	to	assume	high	growth	rates...—that’s	where
people	get	into	a	lot	of	trouble.	The	idea	of	projecting	extremely	high	growth
rates	for	a	long	period	of	time	has	cost	investors	an	awful	lot	of	money.	Go	look
at	top	companies	fifty	years	ago:	how	many	have	grown	at	10%	for	a	long	time?
And	[those	that	have	grown]	15%	is	very	rarified.”													_ -Warren	Buffett

If	there	is	one	thing	that	can	severely	distort	your	intrinsic	value	calculation,	it’s
using	a	large	and	unrealistic	growth	rate.	If	using	this	DCF	model,	this	would	be
your	second	and	fifth	input.	If	using	the	BuffettsBooks	calculator,	this	would	be
the	input	for	the	average	percent	change	in	book	value	per	year.	As	you	can	see
from	Buffett’s	quote	above,	many	investors	get	themselves	into	trouble	when
assuming	a	company	will	have	the	capacity	to	earn	at	an	accelerated	pace	for	an
extended	period	of	time.

As	many	people	already	know,	when	a	company	produces	an	enormous	profit
and	 therefore	 grows	 at	 a	 rapid	 speed,	 it	 has	 an	 interesting	 consequence:
competitors	 take	 notice.	 Take	 Apple,	 for	 example:	 from	 2008—2012,	 Apple
experienced	explosive	earnings	growth	due	to	the	advent	of	smart	phones	and
smart	 tablets.	 At	 the	 time,	 no	 other	 company	 had	 a	 comparable	 product	 that
could	match	the	quality	and	performance	of	an	iPhone	and	iPad.	As	the	market


matured,	in	4-5	years,	Google,	Samsung,	and	Amazon	emerged	with	products
that	started	to	eat	away	at	Apple’s	dominance	in	the	field.	When	we	look	at	this
example,	the	learning	point	is	this;	be	very	cautious	when	assigning	high	growth
rates	for	long	periods	of	time.

In	general,	the	DCF	intrinsic	value	calculator	will	model	a	high-growth	company
better	 than	 the	 BuffettsBooks	 intrinsic	 value	 calculator.	 For	 example,	 if	 you
would	like	the	DCF	model	to	assume	a	company	would	have	a	very	high	growth
rate	(25%)	for	three	more	years,	you	could	then	set	a	modest	long-term	growth
rate	(3%)	for	all	the	years	beyond	that.	In	the	end,	remember	your	ABCs:	be
_accurate_ ,	be	 _balanced_ ,	and	be	 _careful_.

**Theoretical	infinite	growth**

This	 is	 actually	 a	 classical	 problem	 discussed	 amongst	 economists,	 and	 is
referred	to	as	the	 _Saint	Petersburg	paradox_ .	It	simply	states	that	as	long	as	time
is	infinite,	everything	else	is	infinite.

For	the	intrinsic	calculator,	this	can	be	translated	as	meaning	that	as	long	as	the
discount	rate	is	lower	than	the	estimated	growth	rate,	the	value	of	the	stock	is
unlimited	if	the	time	horizon	is	also	unlimited.	Let	me	give	you	an	example:

```
Cash	Taken	out	of	business	(S):			
*	This	is	dividends	recieved	for	1	year
```
```
Current	Book	Value	($):			
*We	need	to	know	this	so	we	can	determine	the	base	value	that’s	changing
```
```
Average	Percent	Change	in	book	value	per	year	(%):			
*This	will	determine	the	estimate	BV	at	the	end	of	the	next	10	years
```
```
Years:			
*This	will	most	likely	be	10	(if	you’re	comparing	a	10	year	federal	note)
```
```
(Discount	Rate)	10	year	federal	note	(%):			
*	Look	up	the	ten	year	treasury	note	by	clicking	on	this	text
```

```
Intrinsic	Value:	$			
```
For	 simplicity,	 I	 have	 omitted	 the	 dividend,	 but	 as	 you	 can	 see,	 even	 with	 a
marginally	higher	average	change	in	book	value	compared	to	the	discount	rate,
the	intrinsic	value	is	approaching	infinite	as	long	as	you	have	a	sufficiently	long-
term	horizon.

So	what’s	the	takeaway?	My	opinion	is	that	any	model	is	only	as	good	as	the
inputs	you	provide.	If	you	assume	a	company	will	grow	by	30%	every	year,
clearly	you	will	find	a	high	intrinsic	value,	even	though	it	is	not	realistic.	If	you
assume	that	your	time	horizon	is	long	enough,	you	will	find	as	high	an	intrinsic
value	as	you	wish.


##### Part	B:	How	to	Assess	Stock	Issuance

In	this	line	of	accounting,	you	can	determine	whether	a	company	has	issued	or
sold	 more	 common	 stock	 in	 order	 to	 raise	 capital.	 Let’s	 first	 talk	 about	 the
issuance	 of	 more	 shares.	 Although	 some	 might	 not	 think	 of	 this	 action	 as	 a
financing	 activity,	 they	 might	 be	 surprised.	 The	 best	 way	 to	 think	 of	 any
additional	stock	offering	is	to	treat	it	like	the	company	is	taking	out	a	loan.	The
only	difference	with	this	type	of	loan	is	that	the	interest	rate	is	for	perpetuity—or
forever.	As	we	think	about	the	impact	that	a	never-ending-term	loan	could	have
on	a	business,	we	quickly	realize	that	the	most	important	consideration	is	the
level	of	interest	rate	we	would	need	to	pay.	So	how	could	we	figure	that	out?

Let’s	make	some	assumptions:	assume	the	company	has	$100,000	equity;	the
equity	produces	a	net	income	(or	profit)	of	$10,000	a	year;	and	there	are	100,000
shares	outstanding	that	trade	for	10	times	earnings	(or	a	P/E	=	10).	The	company
needs	to	raise	more	money	for	a	new	venture;	as	a	result,	they	issue	15,000	new
shares.	Based	on	the	information	provided,	we	know	that	the	earnings	per	share
(EPS)	 are	 $0.10.	 We	 also	 know	 that	 the	 shares	 are	 trading	 at	 $1.00	 each
(EPS*P/E).	As	a	result,	the	issuance	of	15,000	more	shares	will	generally	raise
$15,000	more	dollars.	The	exact	amount	is	arguable,	because	the	company	may
get	 more	 or	 less	 than	 that	 amount	 as	 the	 new	 shares	 are	 traded	 on	 the	 open
market.

So,	let’s	estimate	the	interest	rate	on	that	$15,000	loan!	Prior	to	the	issuance	of
more	shares,	the	company	was	earning	$10,000	a	year.	The	number	of	shares
changed	 from	 100,000	 to	 115,000;	 therefore	 the	 original	 owners	 (or
shareholders)	 now	 only	 own	 86.96%	 of	 their	 previous	 stake	 in	 the	 company.
Based	on	that	reduction	of	equity,	their	claim	on	the	$10,000	of	earnings	is	now
only	$8,696.	If	(and	it’s	a	 _huge_ 	if),	the	company’s	earnings	remain	constant,	the
previous	shareholders	would	be	paying	$1304	on	a	$15,000	loan	annually.	That
equates	to	an	8.7%	perpetuity	loan—that’s	ugly.	But	wait!	It	might	not	be	that
bad...

So	here’s	where	an	understanding	of	assumptions	is	very	important.	Although
the	previous	shareholders	have	reduced	their	share	of	the	company,	they’ve	also
raised	 more	 money	 to	 invest	 into	 new	 assets.	 As	 a	 result,	 let’s	 assume	 the
managers	have	made	a	wise	decision	and	purchased	a	new	machine	with	the	new
funding	and	it	adds	to	the	previous	profit.	To	play	nice,	we	will	assume	the	new
investment	matches	the	previous	return	on	equity	of	10%.	That	means	the	new
$15,000	asset	will	produce	an	additional	profit	of	$1,500	annually.	Now,	as	we


reassess	the	terms	of	our	“loan,”	we	get	a	significantly	different	result.

If	you	remember,	the	original	owners	of	the	business	earned	a	profit	of	$10,000	a
year.	 After	 the	 new	 issue	 of	 stock,	 the	 original	 owner’s	 equity	 decreased	 to
86.96%.	 Although	 the	 decrease	 in	 equity	 occurred,	 the	 company	 was	 able	 to
increase	its	earnings	capacity	due	to	the	new	asset	that	was	purchased.	A	year
later,	the	whole	company’s	earnings	increased	to	$11,500	a	year.	As	a	result,
after	a	year,	the	previous	owners	recuperated	their	original	earnings	capacity	of
$10,000	($11,500	*	86.96%	=	$10,000).

Now,	that	was	a	lot	of	math.	Although	that	might	be	a	little	tricky	to	do,	there’s
no	easy	way	around	determining	whether	a	new	stock	issue	is	going	to	be	good
or	 bad	 for	 the	 company.	 As	 you	 can	 see,	 many	 assumptions	 were	 made;	 for
example,	we	assumed	the	company	could	quickly	(1	year)	turn	the	raised	capital
($15,000)	 into	 a	 return	 that	 matched	 previous	 results	 (10%)—that’s	 a	 lot	 of
assumptions.	Assuming	that	didn’t	happen,	you	can	quickly	see	how	that	8.7%
interest	rate	would	have	extended	into	multiple	years.

More	importantly,	this	entire	situation	was	dependent	on	fairly	stable	factors;	for
example,	let’s	assume	the	company	only	raised	$10,000	(instead	of	$15,000)	for
the	same	number	of	shares;	or	assume	the	company	could	only	earn	a	5%	return
with	 the	 money	 raised.	 All	 those	 factors	 will	 have	 a	 drastic	 impact	 on	 the
perpetuity	loan.	Below	is	a	chart	that	outlines	the	differences	that	would	have
occurred	for	the	original	shareholders	of	the	business	as	each	of	the	assumptions
changed.

```
Capital	Raised	from	issuance	(15K	shares) interest	rate1st	year’s	
```
```
$25,000 5.22%
$20,000 6.52%
$15,000 8.70%
$10,000 13.04%
$5,000 26.09%
```
The	highlighted	line	is	from	the	assumptions	we	used	in	the	example.

The	 table	 above	 accounts	 for	 the	 interest	 for	 the	 first	 year.	 Assuming	 the
company	can	turn	the	capital	into	an	asset	that	will	produce	a	return,	the	table
below	demonstrates	the	subsequent	years’	annual	interest	rate.


Looking	at	this	table,	you	can	see	the	highlighted	areas	represent	the	figures	we
used	in	the	example.	Be	careful—the	numbers	might	be	a	little	counterintuitive.
The	negative	interest	rates	in	the	table	represent	the	perpetuity	profit	that	will	be
made	on	the	stock	issue— _if	_ the	assumptions	were	different	in	the	example.	On
the	flip	side,	the	positive	numbers	represent	the	effective	interest	rate	that	the
previous	owners	would	be	paying	based	on	the	issuance—not	good.

Although	this	table	works	great	for	the	example	provided	in	the	book,	how	can	I
use	 this	 for	 my	 ordinary	 stock	 picks?	 Simple:	 I’ve	 adapted	 these	 charts	 so
they’re	applicable	to	terms	and	ratios	you’ll	find	in	a	per	share	basis.


##### Part	C.	How	to	think	about	a	share	repurchase

As	with	many	things	in	stock	investing,	there	are	no	absolute	metrics	that	say	a
share	 repurchase	 adds	 a	 quantifiable	 value.	 As	 we	 have	 already	 seen	 in	 the
previous	tables	from	chapter	8,	the	main	criteria	are	based	on	the	price	that	the
company	pays	for	buying	back	its	own	stock.


The	reason	price	is	so	important	in	determining	the	value	of	a	share	buy-back	is
due	to	the	idea	of	 _opportunity	costs_ .	For	example:	When	you	buy	a	stock,	you
had	 the	 opportunity	 to	 buy	 a	 bond	 instead.	 The	 yield	 of	 that	 bond	 is	 an
opportunity	cost	to	you.

When	dealing	with	a	share	repurchase,	you	are	faced	with	the	opportunity	costs
of	receiving	the	earnings	from	your	shares	as	a	dividend.

When	a	company	makes	a	profit,	the	money	can	go	two	places.	First,	the	money
can	be	paid	directly	to	the	shareholders.	This	is	called	a	 _dividend_ .	Typically,	a
dividend	 is	 paid	 to	 the	 shareholders	 four	 times	 a	 year.	 The	 second	 place	 the
company’s	 profits	 can	 go	 is	 into	 the	 corporate	 bank	 account.	 This	 is	 called
_retained	earnings_ on	 the	 balance	 sheet.	 The	 intent	 of	 a	 company	 that	 retains
earnings	is	to	enable	it	to	reinvest	the	money	for	you.	Keeping	the	money	inside
the	company	enables	it	to	benefit	from	unique	advantages	such	as	tax	shelters.	If
you’re	interested	in	knowing	how	well	management	is	reinvesting	the	retained
earnings,	simply	look	at	the	ROE.

Receiving	dividends	is	great.	Money	is	deposited	into	your	bank	account	each
quarter,	and	it	gives	you	a	lot	of	flexibility	to	move	your	money	around	to	the
best	investments.	It	also	has	the	added	bonus	of	disciplining	the	management	to
keep	a	strict	control	on	their	cash	and	only	engage	in	the	most	value-enhancing
activities.	Managers	are	just	like	the	rest	of	us.	When	there	is	too	much	money
lying	around,	they	sometimes	spend	it	foolishly.

So	shouldn’t	any	investor	strive	for	a	management	that	favors	dividends	as	much
as	 possible?	 Unfortunately,	 it’s	 not	 that	 simple.	 A	 huge	 counterargument	 for
large	dividend	payments	is	the	tax	implications.	Every	time	a	dividend	is	paid,
you	get	double-taxed.	The	first	tax	is	paid	by	the	corporation	(which	you	own	as
a	shareholder).	The	second	tax	is	paid	when	you	receive	the	dividend	in	your
individual	bank	account.

Now,	you	might	be	getting	confused	as	to	whether	you	should	favor	a	dividend
or	stock	repurchase,	but	don’t	worry—there	are	truly	good	points	for	both	sides
of	the	argument.	So,	let’s	get	back	to	where	we	started	in	chapter	8	with	a	share
repurchase.	As	an	investor,	you	want	to	buy	stocks	at	a	 _price_ 	below	the	 _value_ ,
and	clearly	you	want	management	to	do	the	same	thing.	If	that	is	not	possible,
you	should	opt	to	receive	the	company’s	earnings	as	a	dividend	in	cash,	so	you
have	the	option	to	buy	another	undervalued	stock	on	the	market.

In	the	annual	report,	you	can	find	a	specification	about	the	dividend	and	share


repurchase	policies.	For	any	given	year,	you	can	find	the	money	used	for	both
dividend	payouts	and	share	repurchases	in	the	cash	flow	statement.
