LangChain Chat Application
The LangChain Chat Application is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for interactive querying and response generation based on stored document contexts. It leverages Redis for caching and storage, and integrates with OpenAI for natural language processing tasks.

Features
Interactive Querying: Enter a query text via the command line to retrieve relevant responses based on stored document contexts.

Document Management: Loads Markdown documents from specified directories, splits them into manageable chunks, and stores them in Redis for efficient retrieval.

Natural Language Processing: Uses OpenAI's powerful language models to generate responses based on queried context.
